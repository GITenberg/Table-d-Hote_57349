<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Boots</span>!&rdquo; he
roared, for the second time.&nbsp; His wife, opening the kitchen
door, looked in, and surveyed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have to order you,&rdquo; said Mr. Baynes,
speaking with great distinctness, &ldquo;to come and take off my
boots again, I shall dock half a crown off your weekly allowance
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My best plan,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;will be to draw
it all up in black and white, so that we can have a clear and
proper understandin&rsquo; one with the other.&nbsp; We must have
a proper system of fines, same as they do in every well-regulated
business.&nbsp; Fetch the pen and ink and paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would it be to fetch it for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared at her amazedly.&nbsp; Searching his pockets, he
found there a small memorandum-book and a short piece of
pencil.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to keep calm with you,&rdquo; he
said deliberately, &ldquo;because, so far as I can see,
you&rsquo;ve taken leave, for the present, of your senses.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll be sorry for it when you come back to
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Now then, let&rsquo;s make out a list.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For not answering when called, one
shilling.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote this carefully on a page, regarding it with
satisfaction at the finish.&nbsp; &ldquo;See what that
means?&nbsp; That means, for every time you pretend to be deaf
when I shout at you, you&rsquo;ll be docked a bob at the end of
the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well you do,&rdquo; remarked Baynes
threateningly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will now proceed to the next item:
&lsquo;Food not cooked to W. B.&rsquo;s satisfaction,
one-and-six.&rsquo;&nbsp; How many t&rsquo;s in
&lsquo;satisfaction&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impudence,&rdquo; he continued, writing as he spoke,
&ldquo;one-and-three.&nbsp; Wait a bit; I haven&rsquo;t finished
yet.&nbsp; &lsquo;Clean collar not ready when required,
sixpence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be anything left,&rdquo; mentioned
his wife, &ldquo;if you put many more down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rests with you,&rdquo; giving a careless gesture.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All you&rsquo;ve got to do is to see that none of these
rules are broken.&nbsp; I shall take the trouble presently of
copying out the list, and you&rsquo;ll do well to stick it up on
the wall in some prominent position, so that you can <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>be reminded of
it several times in the course of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when any of my relatives look in they can see it
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reminds me,&rdquo; he said, taking his pencil
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Relations, two a month.&nbsp; All in
excess of this number, fourpence per relation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Take
the list and read it out to me, and then kneel down and take off
my boots as I ordered you to do some considerable time
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Baynes accepted the list, inspected it; then tore the
page into several pieces and threw these into the
fireplace.&nbsp; In the pocket of an underskirt she found a
purse, and from this brought four new banknotes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a good look at them, William,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get a chance of seeing them
again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just going along to the Post Office to put
them away before it closes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how did you come by them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bound to answer you,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
Baynes, &ldquo;but perhaps I may as well.&nbsp; The money has
come to me from poor Uncle Ernest, who popped off last
month.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s left a sim&rsquo;lar amount to my two
sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was his favourite,&rdquo; said Baynes, &ldquo;and
if he&rsquo;d got money to leave&mdash;and this is the first
I&rsquo;ve heard of it&mdash;he ought to have left it all to
you.&nbsp; I must have a glance at his will and see whether we
can&rsquo;t dispute it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>&ldquo;In
any case,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;there is, I&rsquo;m bound to
admit, a very decent little nest-egg for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for us.&nbsp; For me,&rdquo; corrected Mrs.
Baynes.&nbsp; &ldquo;It belongs to me and only to me.&nbsp; You
haven&rsquo;t anything to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;of sudden
riches affecting the brain, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve
actually come across such an instance.&rdquo;&nbsp; He bent and
started to unlace his boots.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk the
matter over again later on.&nbsp; By the by,&rdquo; relacing his
boots, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no reason why you should go out on a
wet night like this and catch your death of cold.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll trot along to the Post Office for you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
more used to handling money than what you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s been the case hitherto,&rdquo; she
admitted, &ldquo;but I must learn how to do it now.&nbsp; You
stay here and enjoy your pipe, and when I come back I&rsquo;ll
tell you how you&rsquo;ve got to behave to me in the
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he inquired with some bitterness,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got your precious sisters to thank for all
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;poor Uncle
Ernest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baynes, on the following morning, before proceeding to work,
denied himself the luxury of issuing commands to his wife from
the front gate in a tone of voice that could be heard by
neighbours; instead he <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>blew a kiss in her direction and
walked off, whistling in a thoughtful way.&nbsp; Later in the day
he brought home the proportion of his weekly wage and placed it
on the mantelpiece, announcing no deductions and giving no
warning to make it last out.&nbsp; He tried to assist his wife in
the performance of domestic duties, persisting in this until she
begged him to go out into the park and give her a chance of
finishing the work.&nbsp; On the next day he accompanied her to
chapel in the evening, and borrowed threepence from her to put
into the plate.&nbsp; Meeting two or three friends on the way
back, he declined their invitations and went home with his wife,
discussing the sermon and the singing.&nbsp; In response to her
appeal he agreed to abstain on future occasions from joining in
the hymns.&nbsp; The Sunday paper was still on the hat-stand, and
on entering the house he asked whether she would mind if he had a
look at it during supper, his general habit being to secure the
journal and keep it for his own use throughout the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very nice and comfortable,&rdquo; he said,
after the meal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Somehow, that little legacy of
yours, if you&rsquo;ll pardon the expression, my dear, seems to
me likely to prove a blessing in disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No disguise about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t quite follow me,&rdquo; he remarked
patiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I mean is that it&rsquo;s going <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>to have bigger
results than I at first anticipated.&nbsp; Of course, it&rsquo;s
a pity there isn&rsquo;t more of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing that I never expected nothing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, quite so.&nbsp; Only that the Post Office
pays such a trifling rate of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money&rsquo;s safe there,&rdquo; she interrupted,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the great thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be the last to recommend anything that
wasn&rsquo;t perfectly and absolutely sound,&rdquo; declared
Baynes.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on good terms with each other
now, and your interests are my interests.&nbsp; We two are one,
so to speak.&nbsp; Only that, getting about as I do, I keep my
ears open&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listeners never hear any good of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sometimes they hear good about other matters.&nbsp;
Two chaps were talking on the tramcar last week, and I was
sitting just at the back.&nbsp; Jockeys from the look of
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t know I was taking in all they
were saying, and they talked quite freely to each other, just as
I might to you in this room.&nbsp; Vinolia was what they were
chatting about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Brown Windsor is as good as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vinolia, it appears,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is
being kept very dark, but the owner&rsquo;s made an arrangement,
so far as I could gather, for it to win the race it&rsquo;s
running in next <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>week, and no one except those that are in the
stable&mdash;&nbsp; Why, bless my soul, if this isn&rsquo;t the
rummiest coincidence I ever come across in all my born
days.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m talking to you about Vinolia, and here my
eye lights on the very name.&nbsp; Thirty-three to one.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s see what it says about it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Vinolia
appears to stand no earthly chance, and we are at a loss to
comprehend why the owner should take the trouble to run
him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does thirty-three to one mean, William?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-three to one means,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;that if you handed me your money and I placed it for you,
and Vinolia came in first, you&rsquo;d get thirty-three times the
amount, together with your original money, back.&nbsp; But the
risk is a jolly sight too great, and I recommend you, speaking as
a friend, to have nothing whatever to do with it.&nbsp; Besides,
with me, it&rsquo;s a matter of principle.&nbsp; I object to
gambling <i>in toto</i>.&nbsp; I look on gambling as one of the
curses of the country.&nbsp; People win money at it, and it
thor&rsquo;ly demoralises &rsquo;em.&nbsp; They bring off
something successful that means they&rsquo;ve cleared as much as
they could earn by honest labour in six or seven weeks, perhaps
more; consequence is that they get altogether unhinged.&nbsp;
Upsets &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Knocks &rsquo;em off the main line.&nbsp;
So my advice to you, old girl, is to put what I&rsquo;ve been
saying clean out of your head, and not <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>trouble any further about it.&nbsp;
After all, supposing you had thirty-three times as much as
you&rsquo;ve got at present, it doesn&rsquo;t by any means follow
you&rsquo;d be thirty-three times as happy.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
the way you&rsquo;ve got to look at it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But supposing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, putting down the newspaper,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been getting on particular well together this
last forty-eight hours or so; don&rsquo;t let us begin arguing
and spoil it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been into the law of the matter,
and I find I&rsquo;ve got no right to touch your money in any way
whatsoever, but it&rsquo;s my positive duty to see that you
don&rsquo;t do anything silly and stupid with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine to do what I like with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s change the subject,&rdquo; urged Baynes,
&ldquo;and have a nice talk over old times.&nbsp; When do you
reckon it was you first felt drawn towards me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Baynes brought downstairs an hour later her Post Office
book, and announced that she had been giving five minutes of
serious thought to the matter.&nbsp; Seemed to her that here was
a chance of a lifetime, and to neglect it would only mean
perpetual remorse.&nbsp; He pointed out once more the serious
risks run by those who backed horses, and submitted a large
number of objections.&nbsp; These she brushed aside.&nbsp; On
asking how she proposed to set about backing Vinolia, <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>it was
admitted that here his help would be required.&nbsp; Baynes
declared he intended to take no share or part in the
undertaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall have
to make inquiries and see about doing it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather than you should be taken in by a set of
rogues,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do as you
wish.&nbsp; But, mind you, I&rsquo;m acting in entire opposition
to my better judgment!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Baynes, back from work on the day of the race, found his wife
waiting at the front gate, tapping at it impatiently; as he came
within six houses of his home, he shook his head.&nbsp; She took
up the hem of her apron, and with this to her eyes ran
indoors.&nbsp; From the kitchen he roared a command to her to
come down and leave off snivelling and make herself useful.&nbsp;
Obtaining no reply, he took the trouble to go to the foot of the
stairs and make the formal announcement that, unless she
descended at once, he would break every bone in her body.&nbsp;
She came, red-eyed, and, kneeling, unlaced his boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you,&rdquo; he
remarked sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every word I uttered has proved to
be true.&nbsp; All your money gone, and your poor Uncle Ernest,
if he&rsquo;s <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>looking down, or up, as the case may be, must feel
sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, William, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m going to tell you the truth,&rdquo;
he said with determination.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the man to
mince my words.&nbsp; You get no sympathy out of me.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s only yourself to blame, and you&rsquo;ve got to
recognise the fact.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to have you going
about saying that you was recommended to back the horse by other
people.&nbsp; What you did, you did with your eyes
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did it come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me,&rdquo; shouted Baynes,
&ldquo;when I&rsquo;m talking!&nbsp; Been and lost the thread of
my argument now.&nbsp; Besides, what does it matter where it came
in?&nbsp; You asked me to back the horse to win; there was
nothing said about backing it for a place.&nbsp; As I told you, I
couldn&rsquo;t get thirty-three to one; but I did, after a lot of
trouble, manage to put your money on at twenty-five.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve behaved straightforward throughout the entire
business, and, now it&rsquo;s over, all I ask is that nothing
more shall be said about it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sick and tired of
the whole affair.&nbsp; Perhaps another time you&rsquo;ll listen
to me when I give you good advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never back a horse again,&rdquo; she declared
tearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get the chance.&nbsp; Take the jug,
and hurry off, and mind you&rsquo;re back here <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>sharp.&nbsp;
I shall give you five minutes; if you&rsquo;re a second later,
there&rsquo;ll be a fine of sixpence.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s an item
to be added to the list.&nbsp; &lsquo;Loitering and gossiping
when sent on errands, six d.&rsquo;&nbsp; Go!&rdquo; he ordered,
placing his watch on the table.</p>
<p>He was pinning the sheet of notepaper to the wall at the side
of the looking-glass when his wife returned.&nbsp; Glancing at
the watch, he waited grimly for her explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to wait,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and find a boy
selling evening newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what might you want, pray, with evening
newspapers?&nbsp; Furthermore, where&rsquo;s the jug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want beer, fetch it!&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That was a good joke of yours about the horse, but
you&rsquo;d better not let me catch you being quite so funny
again.&nbsp; It upset me, and I don&rsquo;t like being
upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snatched the journal from her.&nbsp; She compelled him to
give it back and to take it properly.&nbsp; In the stop-press
space he read out: &ldquo;Vinolia, one; Gay Lothario, two;
Messenger Boy, three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baynes stood gazing at the fire, making the clicking noises
with his tongue which folk adopt when, in disconcerting
circumstances, speech fails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been figuring it out in my head,&rdquo; she
went on, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t make it come twice alike.&nbsp;
Tear down that bit of paper and sit <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>yourself there and reckon it up for
me.&nbsp; Twenty-five times&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you start being stupid,&rdquo; commanded
Mrs. Baynes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baynes had written the figures, and was about to enter on the
task of multiplication, with one hand gripping the top of his
head, when he suddenly threw away the pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you to be so
kind as to listen to me, and I must ask you not to be madder than
you can possibly help.&nbsp; I admit the case is somewhat trying;
but you have to remember that we all have our cross to
bear.&nbsp; I never backed that horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause of some moments in length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said his wife slowly, &ldquo;to look
me in the face and to tell me that, after what you overheard on
the tramcar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never overheard nothing of the kind on the
tramcar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, William, you&rsquo;ll kindly tell me what
horse you did put the money on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;put no money on any
horse whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where is the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the inside pocket of the jacket I&rsquo;m wearing at
the present moment,&rdquo; he said sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did you intend to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t quite made up my mind about <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>that.&nbsp;
Idea was to prevent you from lording it over me.&nbsp; You see,
my dear, I&rsquo;d got accustomed to being master, and the sudden
change was a bit trying.&nbsp; And in picking out what I thought
was the unlikeliest gee-gee, I acted from the purest of motives,
and for what I reckoned the best for all parties concerned.&nbsp;
If I made a mistake, I&rsquo;m sorry for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you realise, William, that if you&rsquo;d obeyed my
orders we should have been in a position to buy a nice little
house of our own here in Old Ford, and never had to pay a
week&rsquo;s rent again?&nbsp; Do you understand how much you owe
me?&nbsp; Do you comprehend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he appealed, putting his hands
together, &ldquo;let me off as light as you can.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t go lording it about the place any more.&nbsp; In
future, I&rsquo;ll only lord it over myself.&rdquo;</p>

17</span>II&mdash;THE TARGET</h2>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> woman stepped on so many toes in making
her way to the far end that the passengers were only willing to
give partial forgiveness when, as the motor-omnibus started, she
gave a violent jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time I&rsquo;ve ever been in one of these
new-fangled contrivances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be the last, if you ain&rsquo;t
careful,&rdquo; said the conductor, punching a penny ticket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I made up my mind to do it,&rdquo; addressing the
others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Down in the country where I live,
they&rsquo;ve been throwing it up agenst me for some time
past.&nbsp; And so I determined, next time I come up to see my
sister, I&rsquo;d take a trip by one of them, jest in order to
see what happened, and&mdash;here I are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A youth next to her, with a girl companion, mentioned that it
was a pity they so often exploded, and blew up in the air; the
girl jerked with her elbow and begged him not to make her laugh
in public.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;You think there&rsquo;s any likelihood?&rdquo;
asked the country lady tremulously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to get mixed up in no fatal accident, and see my name in the
London papers.&nbsp; Shan&rsquo;t never hear the end of it if
that happens.&nbsp; Do they make any warning before they go off
pop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passengers gave up all attempt to read, and offered her
their complete attention.&nbsp; &ldquo;So painful for
friends,&rdquo; said a woman opposite, winking at the rest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Understand what I mean.&nbsp; Having to come and sort out
the bits, and say, &lsquo;That looks like Uncle James&rsquo;s
ear; if I could only find the other one, I should be able to
start piecing him together.&rsquo;&nbsp; You see, they
don&rsquo;t allow compensation unless you can produce the
complete individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo;t seem exactly fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; agreed the humorous
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s lots of things like that
here in London.&nbsp; For instance, if the inspector came in now,
and found you sitting up in the first-class part of the car,
he&rsquo;d want to charge you excess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; she said affrightedly, taking a
grip of her parcel, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better move down nearer
towards the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made room for her in the newly selected position; the
folk there not disguising their satisfaction with the
change.&nbsp; The string of the parcel came undone, and they
assisted <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>her in recovering the contents.&nbsp; &ldquo;Giving
everybody a lot of trouble,&rdquo; she remarked penitently;
&ldquo;and that ain&rsquo;t my usual plan, not by no manner of
means.&nbsp; Can I temp&rsquo; you with a apple, sir?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know you, and I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse what looks
like a liberty, but if you&rsquo;re a judge of a Ribston pippin,
you&rsquo;ll enjoy that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recollect,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;what
&rsquo;appened in the Garden of Eden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That were before my time,&rdquo; she said, putting it
back into her pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I always like to reward
kindness wherever I come across it.&nbsp; And I must say you
London folk are partic&rsquo;lar nice to strangers.&nbsp; Nothing
you won&rsquo;t do for them.&nbsp; When I get back home, I shall
tell my neighbours how pleasant you&rsquo;ve been to me.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s that building supposed to be, may I
ask?&rdquo;&nbsp; Pointing through the window at Bayswater
Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;is a monument put
up to Julius C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; The chap, you know, who was in
the Battle of Trafalgar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember.&nbsp; At least, I say I remember; but
that&rsquo;s a lie.&nbsp; I recollect reading about it when I was
at school.&nbsp; And isn&rsquo;t this a nice open part here,
too!&nbsp; Trees, and goodness knows what all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richmon&rsquo; Park,&rdquo; explained her informant
readily.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the proper name of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Thought that was situated a long way
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; she said resignedly, &ldquo;I find the
best plan in London is to take everything as it comes.&nbsp; What
I&rsquo;ve always been hoping&mdash;&nbsp; But there, it&rsquo;s
no use talking about what isn&rsquo;t likely to
happen.&rdquo;&nbsp; They pressed for details.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
would be too much like luck for it to occur to me.&nbsp; But what
I&rsquo;ve always wished for was that I might catch sight, just
for once in my life, of the new King and Queen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two passengers called her attention eagerly to a couple
walking along by the railings, arm-in-arm; gave a fervid
assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; fanning herself with an
ungloved hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;To think of him strolling along with
a pipe in his mouth, for all the world like an ordinary
individual!&nbsp; And not over-dressed neither.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s something more for me to tell &rsquo;em when I get
home.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t have missed the sight for
anything.&nbsp; But I were always under the impression that he
was a gentleman with a beard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shaves it off, just about this time, every
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she remarked contentedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;More for the sake of change, I suppose, than
anything.&nbsp; Talking of that, I suppose there&rsquo;s nobody
here could oblige me with silver for a sovereign?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Out of
sheer gratitude to an admirable target, they found the coins she
required, and in giving her thanks she mentioned that the sooner
now that she reached Notting Hill the better she would be
pleased.&nbsp; They seemed to have a desire to conceal the truth,
but the conductor happened to overhear the statement; he rang the
bell sharply and informed her she was going in the wrong
direction.&nbsp; She asked him to explain, pointing out that his
conveyance certainly bore the words Notting Hill, and suggesting
that he was possibly making a mistake; the delay to the
motor-omnibus induced her fellow-travellers to declare that the
conductor was telling the truth, and she bade them separately and
collectively goodbye, expressing a hope that she might be so
fortunate as to meet them again on some future visit to town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which way do I go now, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get off the step,&rdquo; replied the irritated
conductor.&nbsp; &ldquo;You cross the roadway.&nbsp; You take a
&rsquo;bus going West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which do you call West?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motor-omnibus restarted.&nbsp; Passengers gazed amusedly
at her, craning necks in the hope of witnessing one more
diverting incident; as she vanished they became quite friendly,
wondering whether she would ever reach her destination, and
speaking of the simplicity and foolishness of country folk.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;What do you make of this sovereign,
conductor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conductor, testing it with the aid of his teeth, announced
he was able to make nothing of it; he doubted whether the owner
would succeed.&nbsp; Alarmed, the rest of the passengers searched
muffs and pockets; three purses were missing, and some articles
of less value.&nbsp; Frantic inquiries for the nearest
police-station.&nbsp; A man who had lost nothing said he
suspected the country lady all along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we ought to be uncommon thankful for,&rdquo; said
the conductor, stopping near Edgware Road, &ldquo;is that she
didn&rsquo;t pinch the blooming &rsquo;bus!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>III&mdash;MOVING PICTURES</h2>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">should</span> never have
come to you,&rdquo; he said, making a furious dash under his
signature, &ldquo;only that I&rsquo;ve been rather annoyed and
upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was clearly in the wrong, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; he declared, with emphasis.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s made me feel that I want to get away for a time
from everything and everybody.&nbsp; And yours is the only
establishment of its kind.&nbsp; Cheque&rsquo;s all right, I
hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, too,&rdquo; said the voice.&nbsp; And called
out, &ldquo;Pass one!&rdquo;&nbsp; A curtain pulled aside and the
young man, his chin out determinedly, moved.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
the four slips, please.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to fill them
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A reading candlestick with a reflector stood in the corner of
the dark room, which had a faint scent of burnt hay, and he went
across to it carefully, but not so carefully as to escape
collision, in which a hassock <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>appeared to be the less injured
party.&nbsp; An extended easy-chair permitted itself to be seen
within reach of the shaded light, and he sat upon this and read
the instructions printed at the head of slip Number One.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Please Write Distinctly&rdquo; prefaced the three or four
precise and dogmatically worded rules.&nbsp; He took a pencil,
wrote out his desire, and settled back in the long chair.&nbsp; A
hand presented to him a pipe that looked a ruler, and he took two
short whiffs.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>His feeling of accumulated annoyance vanished on realising the
instant result.&nbsp; Here he was, in the very centre of the
old-fashioned winter he had ordered, stamping up and down in the
snow that powdered the courtyard; through the archway he
identified the main thoroughfare as Holborn.&nbsp; A cheerful
cloud and an agreeable scent of coffee came from the doorway, and
through the doorway came also at intervals apprehensive
travellers, who gave a look of relief on discovering that the
stage coach had not set off without them.&nbsp; Ostlers brought
sturdy horses from the stables, horses that seemed anxious to do
right, but somehow failed at every point to conciliate the men,
who on their side did not attempt to hide opinions.&nbsp; The
youth advanced across the cobble-stones and inquired at what hour
the stage coach was supposed to start; the ostler gave an answer
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>almost
identical in terms with the fierce denunciation used to the
animals.&nbsp; The coarseness staggered him until he remembered
the year, and the absence of education in the lives of the class
to which the ostler belonged.&nbsp; He turned to speak to the
driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not what I call cold,&rdquo; answered the driver,
snatching a piece of straw from a truss and starting to chew
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember January in &rsquo;27?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a teaser,&rdquo; said the coachman.&nbsp; He
gave four slaps to each shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Snowed up jest
afore we got to Reading.&nbsp; No chance of escape.&nbsp; Not a
bit of food after the third day.&nbsp; Fortunately, the guard was
a plumpish man; Tom Bates his name was; the chap who&rsquo;s with
us to-day is thin, I&rsquo;m sorry to say.&nbsp; Bates&rsquo;s
widow took it very well, considerin&rsquo; how onreasonable some
women are.&nbsp; Course, the passengers made a collection for
her.&nbsp; Tottled up poor Tom, they did, and paid for him at the
rate of eightpence a pound.&nbsp; As she very properly remarked,
it isn&rsquo;t every widow that can say of her late husband that
he was worth his weight in copper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man offered his cigar-case, and the driver, with a
dexterous scoop, took the whole of the contents and dropped them
into one of his enormous pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the outside passengers that suffer <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>most,&rdquo;
the driver went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You recollect that case of a
gen&rsquo;leman on the box-seat a year ago this very day?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t say you never &rsquo;eerd tell of him!&nbsp; He
belonged to a banking firm in Lombard Street, and he started,
just as you might, from this very spot, cheerful and warm and as
pleased with himself as anybody could wish to be.&nbsp; Talked a
bit at first, but before we were ten miles out he had left off,
and when we got twenty miles out I gave him a jerk with the butt
end of my whip like this, and&mdash;&nbsp; What do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should imagine that he resented the
impertinence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have done all that you say,&rdquo; remarked
the driver, slapping one of the horses, &ldquo;only he was
froze.&nbsp; Froze stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; cried the young man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a shocking end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t the end, bless you.&nbsp; Tried all
we knew to bring back his circulation, but nothing seemed any
use, and it wasn&rsquo;t until we got to a oast-house and got the
hop-driers to put him in the oven&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hops in December?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a late year,&rdquo; said the driver
calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything were behindhand.&nbsp; But what I
was going to say was this.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got a
box-seat.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a gen&rsquo;leman in there drinking
his second cup, with something in <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>it, and he&rsquo;s a good-natured
chap, and he&rsquo;s willing to change his inside seat for
yours.&nbsp; Say the word, and it&rsquo;s done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth congratulated himself upon his acuteness in seeing
through the device, but later, when he ducked his head on the
stage coach going through the archway and adjusting his muffler,
made a polite reference to the weather and its possibilities, the
driver, who was smoking one of the cigars, responded only with a
grunt.&nbsp; He tried again as they took a corner rather
narrowly, and this time the driver made no response of any
kind.&nbsp; Later, when a hackney coach called out something
derisive, he ventured to suggest a retort, and then the driver
hinted plainly that he was not in the mood for conversation, that
if he should change his views he would make intimation of the
circumstance; in the meantime the young man had better talk
quietly to himself, or address his remarks to one of the other
passengers.&nbsp; The youth, giving up with regret the impression
that all stagecoach drivers were communicative, cheery, and
dispensers of merry anecdotes, turned to a fellow-traveller
seated behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seasonable weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; mentioned the young man deferentially,
&ldquo;it was seasonable weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked the passenger behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now.&nbsp; At the present time.&nbsp; I mean that, <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>whether you
agree with me or not, the weather to-day is weather
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what you do mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m driving at,&rdquo; he asserted,
becoming somewhat nettled; &ldquo;but apparently I don&rsquo;t
make sufficient allowance for lack of intelligence on your
part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it didn&rsquo;t mean taking my hands out of my
pocket,&rdquo; said the passenger behind, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d knock
your head clean off your shoulders.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what
I&rsquo;d do to you.&nbsp; Clean off your shoulders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pulled up at a roadside inn, and the young man,
thoughtful and slightly moody after these rebuffs, brightened as
he swung himself down with assistance from the axle and, stamping
to and fro, endeavoured to restore circulation.&nbsp; Two ladies,
one old and one young, stepped from the interior of the coach and
looked around distractedly.&nbsp; He went forward and asked
whether he could be of any service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lunch?&rdquo; he echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, of
course!&nbsp; I declare I had nearly forgotten lunch.&nbsp; Pray
follow me.&nbsp; The others have preceded us, but
doubtless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are greatly indebted to you, sir,&rdquo; declared
the elder lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;My niece is unused to any but the
most delicate refinements of life, and it is on her account
rather than my own that I ventured to appeal to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could wish for no greater honour,&rdquo; he <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>said, bowing,
&ldquo;than to render assistance to beauty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl
blushed, and looked very properly at the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a most objectionable travelling companion, so
different from the class my niece and myself mix with.&nbsp; Her
grandfather, you will be interested, perhaps, to hear, was no
less a person than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the largest room (which seemed too small for its sudden
rush of custom) male passengers were feeding themselves noisily
and screaming, with mouths full, to the dazed serving-maids and
to the apoplectic landlady; they gave a casual glance at the two
ladies and their escort, and made no effort to give space at the
one table.&nbsp; The young man appealed; they jerked him off
impatiently.&nbsp; One continued an anecdote after the
interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are any gentlemen present,&rdquo; said the
youth, in a loud voice, &ldquo;will they be so good as to note
that here are two ladies, desirous of obtaining some refreshment
before proceeding on the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, and the sulky passenger who had travelled
in the second seat looked up from his tankard, which he had
nearly finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say &lsquo;if&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>&ldquo;That was the first word of my remark,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s my answer to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies shrieked and fainted.&nbsp; The youth, wiping from
his face the contents of the sulky man&rsquo;s tankard, demanded
whether any one possessed a brace of pistols.&nbsp; Willing hands
pressed forward, showing an eagerness to assist that had hitherto
been absent.&nbsp; As the serving-maids brought burnt feathers to
the two lady passengers, he strode out to a snow-covered field at
the back, the conductor in attendance, the rest tossing coins on
the way to decide who should have the honour of supporting the
sulky man.&nbsp; The coachman, restored to cheerfulness, paced
the ground with laborious exactitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready, gentlemen?&nbsp; Then at the word
&lsquo;Three.&rsquo;&nbsp; One, two&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>He filled in the second form, with a determination to get as
far away as possible from the winter of years ago.&nbsp; The
ruler-like pipe was again handed to him; he took this time but a
single whiff, for it occurred to him that in his first experiment
he had perhaps erred on the side of extravagance.&nbsp; There was
no need to give himself a series of shocks.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The youth went down Great Portland Street in such good humour
with himself that he <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>greatly desired to confer a benefit
on somebody, to assist some one less fortunate.&nbsp; He looked
about for an old woman selling matches, or for a boy shivering in
the attempt to dispose of newspapers, and unable to find either,
searched for a narrow side-street, where he might hope to have
better success.&nbsp; Here again he received a check, for
Devonshire Street and Weymouth Street and New Cavendish Street
had disappeared, and in their place he found one broad, straight
thoroughfare; he made inquiries and found it was called J &amp;
C.&nbsp; This he did not mind, and, indeed, it seemed an
excellent arrangement when, anticipating that the next street
would be J &amp; D, he found this to be the case.&nbsp; But he
still wanted to play the part of Lord Bountiful, and to satisfy
his appetite for benevolence, and it pained him&mdash;although on
broad grounds this should have furnished gratification&mdash;that
up to the present he had discovered none who varied in apparent
prosperity; not a high-level by any means, but, so far as he
could perceive, an unmistakable level.&nbsp; Little variation
existed in costume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will excuse me&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must pardon me, please, for speaking,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely give the name, but if you <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>will permit
me to explain, I think I could make it clear to you,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t chatter,&rdquo; interrupted the man
curtly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t call me sir.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re as good as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; retorted the youth, with
spirit, &ldquo;why you should think it necessary to mention the
fact!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you had apparently forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go for a moment.&nbsp; I only wish to ask
one question.&nbsp; Where are the poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spell it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man complied; the other shook his head.&nbsp; They
took to the edge of the broad pavement; the centre appeared to be
rigidly reserved for those who were youthful and walked with a
certain briskness, whilst either side was used by elderly folk,
and by those whose movements were deliberate.&nbsp; The young man
gave further details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean now,&rdquo; said the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was a story about a man like yourself in one of the
journals the other day.&nbsp; He, too, had been away in a distant
colony for his health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the humorous journals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of our journals are humorous.&nbsp; Any paragraph
or column in which a pleasing strain of the ludicrous does not
appear is blacked out by the censor.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t always
very clever, but it has to be as clever as <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>can be
reasonably expected for thirty-two and six a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One pound twelve and sixpence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rate fixed by the central governing body,&rdquo;
said the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every man on leaving school receives
a wage of thirty-two and six a week, and in this way all the old
class distinctions have vanished, the yawning spaces between the
clever and the foolish, the industrious and the indolent have
been bridged.&nbsp; The sum was fixed&mdash;this may interest
you&mdash;because it was found that a narrow majority existed of
those earning less than that amount, and the injustice of the
change was therefore lessened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sure that I quite follow you,&rdquo; he said
politely, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s exceedingly good of you to take
so much trouble.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not delaying you from your
work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as I do thirty hours a week, it doesn&rsquo;t
matter when I do them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ideal existence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; cried the man, with triumph.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we have been aiming at!&nbsp; Just what
we have achieved.&nbsp; Nothing short of perfection is good
enough for us.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s any sensible criticism you
can pass upon our present conditions, we shall be ready to
consider it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
miss the poor, especially at this time of the year, when I feel
generous.&nbsp; But of course <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>it&rsquo;s all to the good to have
altered that.&nbsp; Only where are the children?&nbsp; I should
like to see some children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to manage without them, unless you
can get a special permit from the Minister of Education in
Whitehall.&nbsp; In the old days parents were, I believe, allowed
to bring up children in almost any manner they thought fit, and
some of the results were exceedingly unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Let me
see!&rdquo;&nbsp; He considered for a few moments, detaining the
other with one hand; his brow wrinkled with the effort of
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pinner!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;I
rather think Pinner is the nearest.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find about
five thousand youngsters in the Infant Barracks there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do with less,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What I want is about three or four, nephews and nieces if
possible; just enough to play at charades, and musical chairs,
and games of some one going out of the room&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
The other smiled pityingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Going out of the room
whilst the rest think of a man alive, and then the person who has
been outside comes in and puts questions, and gradually guesses
who it is.&nbsp; Surely they still play at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, under the old scheme, a child wasted
valuable years.&nbsp; Now we arrange that not a single
opportunity shall be missed.&nbsp; Go to any of the barracks and
you will find that every child, providing it has begun to <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>speak, can
give quite a pretty little lecture on, say, milk, with all the
latest scientific facts relating to the subject.&nbsp; Each
youngster is made to realise the value of moments.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Time is Flying&rsquo; are the words that form the only
decoration on the walls of the dormitories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; Folk going by stopped
and raised eyebrows at this outbreak of irritation; a small crowd
gathered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I see why you make your journals
amusing.&nbsp; You learn nearly everything in your early days,
but you omit to learn how to laugh.&nbsp; When you are grown up,
you have to adopt the most determined means in order
to&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He went on with excitement as he addressed
the increasing circle around him.&nbsp; The frowns and the
murmurs did not prevent him from speaking his mind, and he
commenced to whirl his arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you what it
is.&nbsp; I came here expecting to find happiness.&nbsp; The
present didn&rsquo;t suit me and I thought I&rsquo;d try the past
and the future.&nbsp; I declare you&rsquo;re worse than
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd closed in.&nbsp; The man to whom he had been
speaking tugged at his sleeve; he gave a sharp jerk and
disengaged himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the conceit of you is the most unsatisfactory
feature of the whole situation.&nbsp; What have you to be proud
about?&nbsp; Here you are in the New Year, and not one of you is
showing any special signs of amiability <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>towards his
fellow-man; you can&rsquo;t look back to a cosy family gathering;
you have bought no presents, and you have received none.&nbsp; If
you knew how much you had lost, you would never rest until you
had&mdash;&nbsp; But I suppose you are too sensible.&nbsp; Ah,
you don&rsquo;t like to be accused of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took him at a run through the straight street that in his
time had been curved and called Regent, crying as they went,
&ldquo;To the fountain, to the fountain!&rdquo;&nbsp; Almost
dazed by the swiftness, and nearly choked by the grip at the back
of his collar, he nevertheless recognised that their intentions
were not friendly, and he endeavoured to struggle and make
escape.&nbsp; He heard the sound of ice being smashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, boys.&nbsp; Altogether!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dozen pair of hands competed for the honour of ducking him;
they seized his wrists, elbows, head, ankles.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t read this,&rdquo; said the voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve written it so badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my best penmanship,&rdquo; he admitted
tremblingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What it&rsquo;s intended for
is&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He wrote it afresh.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
I&rsquo;m&rsquo; giving too much trouble, you can tear it up and
let me go.&nbsp; I can easily find what I want, once I&rsquo;m
outside.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s the time going?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The smallest boy, overcoated and muffled <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>to the eyes,
had been dispatched to meet visitors at the station, and a good
deal of anxiety existed in the household when one of his sisters
mentioned a grisly fear that he would talk too much on the way,
betraying facts which should be hidden and guarded as
secrets.&nbsp; His mother declared Franky had too much common
sense to make a blunder of the kind, and, giving a final
look-round in the dining-room, expressed a hope that there would
be room for everybody.&nbsp; She had no doubts concerning food
supplies, and, indeed, any one who peeped into the kitchen, and
saw the two noble birds there, would have been reassured on this
point; the cold pies formed an excellent reserve in case the
birds should be reduced, by the invaders, to ruins.&nbsp; The
young man, looking on, without being seen, noticed the eldest
girl (whom he loved) standing perilously on a high chair to give
a touch with duster to a frame, and nearly screamed an urgent
appeal for care; it was a relief to see her step down to the
safety of the carpet.&nbsp; He was wondering whether he would
come into the pleasant household, and found some encouragement in
the circumstance that she took a particular interest in her
reflection in the mirror; left alone for a moment, she selected
his card from the rest which crowded the mantelpiece and kissed
it.&nbsp; She also peeped behind the screen, and counted the
crackers there; when her mother called, <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>requesting to
be done up at the back, she went immediately.&nbsp; A dear girl;
he could scarce remember why or how he had found an excuse for
quarrelling.</p>
<p>Voices of youngsters outside the front door, and the small
brother rattling at the letter-box in his impatience.&nbsp; One
of the two maids, answering, found herself as nearly as possible
bowled over in the narrow hall, saving herself by clutching at a
peg of the hat-stand and allowing the inrush to sweep by and
through to the drawing-room.&nbsp; All the children loaded with
parcels, which they dropped on the way, and all shouting:
&ldquo;Many happy returns, many happy returns!&rdquo; and
demanding the immediate production of an aunt, and several
cousins, paying no regard whatever to the reminders from elders
that they had formally promised to behave like little ladies and
gentlemen.</p>
<p>The hostess came down in a stately way, pretending to be
unaware of the fact that she was wearing a new dress.&nbsp; The
visitors had experienced some amazing adventures on the journey,
and they told them in chorus, with many interruptions, given in
solo form and made up of urgent amendments concerning unimportant
details.&nbsp; Such funny people they had met in the train, to be
sure; somehow at this time of the year one always encountered the
most extraordinary folk.&nbsp; And just as they <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>started, who
should come rushing along the platform, just too late to catch
the train, but Mr.&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here you are!&rdquo; turning to the eldest girl,
who had entered the room, to be instantly surrounded and tugged
in every direction by the youngsters.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were just
telling your mother that your friend&mdash;&nbsp; Oh, look at her
blushing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put dinner back twenty minutes,&rdquo; said
the mother, interposing on her daughter&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That will give him time if he catches the next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he never meant to come by that train,&rdquo;
said Uncle Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very likely he&rsquo;s gone off
somewhere else.&nbsp; One can never depend on these
bachelors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tease away,&rdquo; said the girl courageously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To tell you the truth, I rather like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; remarked the uncle, &ldquo;I
decline to proceed.&nbsp; If I can&rsquo;t give annoyance, I
shall simply shut up.&nbsp; Supposing I have a kiss
instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tragic moments for the children who were being released from
the control of neck-wraps and safety-pins and rubber shoes, for,
apart from the tantalising scent of cooking, they had to endure
the trial of saying nothing about the parcels brought.&nbsp; They
clustered around the eldest girl, knowing this to be the surest
quarter for entertainment, and she would have found a dozen arms
few <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>enough
for the embraces they required; some of their questions she
answered as though her mind were absent, and she glanced now and
again, when everybody was talking, at the clock on the
mantelpiece.&nbsp; A sharp knock at the front door made smiles
come again to her features; the mother gave a warning word to the
kitchen and met the young man in the hall, where the boys were
helping him in the task of disengaging himself from his overcoat
by pulling at it in all directions.&nbsp; He could not express
his regrets at the missing of the train, but every one knew what
motor-omnibuses were, and as he shook hands formally with the
eldest girl (who appeared rather surprised, remarking to him,
&ldquo;Oh, is that you?&rdquo;) an aunt began a moving anecdote
concerning one of these conveyances which she had boarded on a
recent afternoon opposite St. Martin&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; She
asked the conductor as distinctly as she could speak whether it
went to the Adelaide, and she felt certain that he replied,
&ldquo;Yes, lady,&rdquo; but, happening to glance out later,
found herself whirling along Marylebone Road, whereupon she, with
great presence of mind, took her umbrella, prodded the conductor
in the small of his back&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, &rsquo;m, dinner is served!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were chairs at the long table that had the shy
appearance of having been borrowed from the bedroom, but only one
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>of the
children made a remark concerning this, and she found herself
told that another word from her would result in a lonely return
to home forthwith.&nbsp; They all declared they had plenty of
room, and Uncle Henry accepted with modesty a position near to
the birds with the comment that he could always manage to eat a
couple; perhaps the others would not mind looking on whilst he
enjoyed the pleasures of the table; the children, now accustomed
to Uncle Henry&rsquo;s humour, declined to be appalled by this
threat, and, indeed, challenged him, offering the prize of one
penny if he should consume the contents of the dishes, bones and
all.&nbsp; They stopped their ears whilst he sharpened the big
knife, and when he said, &ldquo;Now, has any one got any
preference?&rdquo; the grown-ups gave a fine lesson in behaviour
by declaring that they would be content with whatever portions
were sent down to them.&nbsp; The maid, waiting at table,
exhibited evidence of mental aberration over the task of handing
plates in the right order of precedence, but wireless telegraphy
from her mistress, and from the eldest daughter, gave
instructions and averted disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do look after yourself, Uncle Henry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Henry asserted that, but for this reminder, he would
have neglected to fill his own plate, and one of the children,
unable to reconcile the extreme selfishness hinted at <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>in an earlier
stage with the astonishing effacement now proclaimed, stared at
him open-mouthed.&nbsp; The same child later on, after expressing
loudly his determination not to be frightened when the
plum-pudding&mdash;over a month old and the last of its
race&mdash;was brought, surrounded by a purple blaze, found
performance a harder task than that of hypothetical daring, and,
burying his little head in the lap of the eldest daughter, gave
way to tears, declining to resume the appearance of serenity
until the flames had been blown out; he regained complete
self-possession on finding in the portion served out to him a
bright silver sixpence, and announced his intention of purchasing
with that sum Drury Lane Theatre, together with the pantomime for
the current year.&nbsp; The elder children listened with
tolerance and gave a nod to the grown-ups, showing that they knew
the sum would be altogether insufficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Uncle Henry, after he had resolutely
turned his head away from the offer of a second meringue,
&ldquo;if I never have a worse dinner, I shan&rsquo;t
complain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautifully cooked,&rdquo; agreed the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Credit to whom credit is due,&rdquo; asserted the
hostess generously.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Mary there hadn&rsquo;t
superintended&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, dear!&rdquo; protested the eldest girl.</p>
<p>Great jokes in trying to induce the ladies <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>to smoke, but
the men were left alone together with the eldest son of the
family, who had not yet taken to cigarettes and was strongly
recommended by the others never to begin.&nbsp; The eldest son
found his views on tobacco, on the work of borough councils, on
parliamentary procedure, and other topics, listened to with great
deference by the young man visitor, who declared there was a
great deal in the opinions held by the son of the family with
which he felt able to agree.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was he who
first suggested that they should rejoin the company of the
ladies.</p>
<p>He came out wonderfully so soon as games were started, but it
appeared he could do little without the assistance of the eldest
daughter.&nbsp; Together, they gave an exhibition of
thought-reading, and, after whispered consultation, he, being out
of the room whilst the children selected four figures, came in
when called, and standing at the doorway whilst she appealed for
order, gave the exact figures.&nbsp; Even Uncle Henry had to
admit himself flabbergasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell us how it&rsquo;s done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe you know yourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They declared it a secret which could not be lightly shared,
but in giving way to the general appeal, explained that if the
first figure was (say) one, then she had used a <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>sentence
beginning with the first letter of the alphabet, such as:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All quiet, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the next was two, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the next was three:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you be quiet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so on.&nbsp; Parcels came in now and strings were cut, and
presents given to the owner of the day.&nbsp; She thanked him
very prettily for the brooch and pinned it at once near to her
neck; he followed her out of the room to help in carrying the
brown paper and to tell her that, when his birthday came, she
could reciprocate by offering him the precious gift of
herself.&nbsp; The quarrel had been all his fault.&nbsp; He was
bending down to touch her lips when&mdash;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; he said, tearing up the fourth
slip.&nbsp; &ldquo;The present time is good enough for me.&nbsp;
Is this the way out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting to observe,&rdquo; remarked the voice, as
the curtain went back and showed the exit, &ldquo;that our
clients, however dissatisfied they may be in entering, are always
perfectly content when they depart!&rdquo;</p>

51</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Let</span> me get this yer
all down on paper,&rdquo; said George Hunt, searching his
pockets.&nbsp; &ldquo;I find if I trust to my memory everything
goes clean out of my &rsquo;ead.&nbsp; Been like that since I was
a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man from London with the empty kit bag remarked that
George was scarcely an octogenarian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in eating roast meat if I can get it,&rdquo;
admitted the lad.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never been what you London people
call a crank.&nbsp; Spite of which, somehow or other, I
don&rsquo;t seem to make what you may call progress, and
that&rsquo;s the truth, Mr. Polsworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that is my name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;All I
know is that that&rsquo;s the name you&rsquo;ve give up at the
&lsquo;Unicorn&rsquo; where you be staying.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
something I can write on.&nbsp; &lsquo;Advice to Intending
Emigrants.&rsquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got no special use for
that.&nbsp; Now then, sir, let&rsquo;s have it all over
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>&ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; said the London man, drawing
him away to a sheeted truck, and speaking with great
distinctness, &ldquo;to take a message for me up to the
Vicarage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;ve very often
considered to myself,&rdquo; said George, stopping with the paper
flat against the truck.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there a &lsquo;k&rsquo;
in it, or isn&rsquo;t there a &lsquo;k&rsquo; in it, or
doesn&rsquo;t it matter whether you put one or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see Miss Thirkell, and tell her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one with the reddish hair, isn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one with black hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not fur out,&rdquo; remarked George,
complacently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continued
to write laboriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her that some one from town wishes to see her on
important business, and will she be at the station here at
half-past eight this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve got their party on.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Sides which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sides which there&rsquo;s no train about that
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her to go by train,&rdquo; shouted
the other in an irritable way.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only want to have a
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me asking, sir, but is it love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful thing, once it catches you.&nbsp; <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>I never been
mixed up in it to any considerable extent, but I keep my eyes
open, and I noticed that once parties get affected by it, why
there&rsquo;s no telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;is the case with
me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all on her account that I have come down
here for a week, and I find it impossible for me to go back until
I have seen her.&nbsp; Just a few whispered words of affection
with her and October to me will seem like June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t promise to repeat all you say word for
word,&rdquo; mentioned George, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll give her the
general bearing of your remarks.&nbsp; I shall say that
you&rsquo;re over head and ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Mr. Polsworthy, with something
like enthusiasm, &ldquo;I shall have to give you a present.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re an honest, worthy fellow, and the most intelligent
young man in the whole village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said that to myself,&rdquo; declared George,
&ldquo;frequent.&rdquo;&nbsp; He folded the document.&nbsp;
&ldquo;About what time, sir, did you think of getting me to do
this little job for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Londoner had finished an address on the slothfulness
of country life, he permitted himself to announce, more calmly,
that he expected it to be performed now and at once.&nbsp; The
young railway porter went across the station-yard, spoke a word
to the signalman on duty, and started off up the hill at a pace
that seemed too good to last.&nbsp; He did, indeed, return to say
that if later Mr. <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>Polsworthy observed he was wearing a white flower in his
jacket, this might be taken as a hint that Miss Thirkell was
willing to keep the appointment; if the flower was red, it would
indicate she was unable to come.&nbsp; Mr. Polsworthy went to his
hotel, where, with the aid of scented soap, he put good sharp
points to his moustache, and ordered, seemingly to give
opportunity for range and ability in criticism, certain
refreshment; the landlady said that his complaint was the first
she had received since the year &rsquo;92, and strongly
recommended him to take his bag to the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
Head,&rdquo; which possessed but a limited licence.&nbsp; Mr.
Polsworthy, in apologising, remarked that he was one accustomed
to the very best of everything, and the lady expressed an opinion
that his looks and general appearance failed to bear out this
assertion.</p>
<p>George Hunt, sweeping the platform, was wearing a red flower,
and Mr. Polsworthy turned away regretfully, to consider some new
mode of approaching the vicarage lady.&nbsp; A whistle recalled
him, and George managed to make it clear that everything was
right; he had placed the wrong flower in his jacket&mdash;a
mistake, he said, that might have happened to anybody.&nbsp;
George seemed highly interested now in the scheme, and produced a
beard with wires to go over each ear; challenged, he confessed
that he was not prepared to say to what use it should be put, or
to declare that <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>it was of any use, but it had been in his possession for
some time, and he felt that either he or Mr. Polsworthy ought to
wear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that means,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;recognition, if
you understand what I mean, will be avoided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who is there to recognise us, and what does it
matter if we are recognised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is that,&rdquo; conceded George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool,&rdquo; declared Mr.
Polsworthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the first to pass that remark to me, not by a long
chalk, you ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Mother says it &rsquo;bout once a
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Thirkell came up the slope of the platform, and George
went back discreetly to his work with the broom, touching his cap
to the young woman as she went by.&nbsp; She acknowledged the
salutation distantly, saying, &ldquo;Good evening, my man!&rdquo;
and gave a start of amazement on Mr. Polsworthy lifting his hat
and throwing away his cigar.&nbsp; She said that he had the
advantage over her and he expressed regret that her memory should
constitute the one defect in an otherwise perfect and beautiful
nature.&nbsp; Was it, asked Miss Thirkell, was it in Dover
Street, the tenth of July of the current year, on the occasion of
coming out of a dressmaker&rsquo;s with her mistress?&nbsp; That,
answered Mr. Polsworthy, was the very moment, and the precise
occasion.&nbsp; Miss Thirkell considered this curious and
interesting, since she was not in town on <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the date
mentioned, and had never been in Dover Street.</p>
<p>Mr. Polsworthy, slightly taken aback, begged of her to refresh
a brain that could never be relied upon implicitly; she admitted
that they had met once.&nbsp; Miss Thirkell remembered the day
well, because her master took the opportunity to make some
extensive purchases at a sale in King Street, St. James&rsquo;s,
and the articles had crowded the compartment on the way down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A race special came in,&rdquo; said Mr. Polsworthy,
corroborating, &ldquo;just before your train went out from
Victoria, and whilst your people were having a few words with the
guard I strolled across to see what was the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried Miss Thirkell, delightedly,
&ldquo;now I know you&rsquo;re telling the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mistress, it appeared, was one who did not mind the
expenditure of money in useful things, such as dress and hats,
but entertained a strong objection to lumbering the house with a
lot of old silver and other articles, neither, in her opinion,
useful or decorative.&nbsp; Mr. Polsworthy expressed the view
that in married life certain concessions had to be made; he had
not hitherto considered the possibility of entering the state,
but he was prepared to be generous in the direction referred
to.&nbsp; George Hunt, each time they went by, looked up and
nodded and made some reference to the weather; there was <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>more rain
about, in his opinion; what we wanted was sunshine, so that
cricket bats might be once more used.&nbsp; The two, interested
in their own conversation, scarcely gave notice to his
meteorological comments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can I come up and see you?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Polsworthy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only down here for a little
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What seems so wonderful,&rdquo; sighed Miss Thirkell,
dreamily, &ldquo;is that you should have come specially to meet
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do that I would travel to the furthermost ends of
the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Axcuse me interrupting,&rdquo; said George, suddenly,
&ldquo;but in which direction do you reckon Canada is?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re better acquainted with geography than what I
am.&nbsp; S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; now, you was going to walk there;
which turning would you take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Thirkell cried alarmingly that she had to be getting
home; she had no idea the hour was so late.&nbsp; On Mr.
Polsworthy offering to accompany her, she gave a short sharp
scream and declared this impossible; he, a Londoner, little knew
the appetite for scandal that existed in country villages.&nbsp;
George, corroborating, said that if, for instance, he himself
were observed escorting Miss Thirkell across the line, there were
busybodies about who would assert they were as good as
engaged.&nbsp; The visitor seemed inclined to snap fingers at
public opinion, and dare it to do its <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>worst; the young woman said this was
all very well for him, but not nearly good enough for her; she
had no wish to lose an excellent situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Character&rsquo;s everything in these parts,&rdquo;
confirmed George.&nbsp; &ldquo;Up in London it probably
don&rsquo;t matter, but here it&rsquo;s important.&nbsp; When I
leave the line&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will to-night at ten be a suitable time for me to call
at the house to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, good man,&rdquo; cried Miss Thirkell,
&ldquo;you must be off your head to think of carrying on like
that!&nbsp; Why, the dog would make short work of any one who
wasn&rsquo;t in uniform.&nbsp; Besides, the butler has to go down
to the gate and let in everybody that comes to the party.&nbsp;
Now I must run.&nbsp; You send a message through George
Hunt.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s reliable.&nbsp; We were boy and girl
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wave of the hand she went.&nbsp; Mr. Polsworthy looked
steadily at George for some moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dull dog,&rdquo; he said, slowly,
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the only thing which makes me inclined to
trust you.&nbsp; If you were a sharp lad, the idea would never
come into my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for straightforwardness
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no use,&rdquo; said the other, with a burst of
recklessness, &ldquo;no sense whatever in disguising the fact
that I&rsquo;m madly in love with that girl.&nbsp; And when a
man&rsquo;s in love, there&rsquo;s nothing he&rsquo;s not
prepared to do.&nbsp; In some <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>way I must manage to gain admission
to that house this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in some way, you&rsquo;ll have to manage to get out
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An easy matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George looked in at the booking-hall to make sure that no
passengers were about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the first, mister, that&rsquo;s tried
it on,&rdquo; he remarked in an undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the last man in the
world to do anything dishonest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are,&rdquo; said George, evenly, &ldquo;that
means Wormwood Scrubs will have to be took over by the White
City.&nbsp; In any case, your best plan is to treat me fairly,
and treat me generously, and I&rsquo;ll do what I can, so long as
my name&rsquo;s not brought into it.&nbsp; My name must be kept
out, on account of mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Polsworthy declared his satisfaction, and hinted at
surprise, on finding that George possessed so much
acuteness.&nbsp; He did, in a general way, prefer to work alone,
but sometimes cases were encountered&mdash;here was
one&mdash;where assistance was indispensable.&nbsp; The great
thing was to have a quiet half-hour inside the vicarage, and to
catch the 10.23 p.m. for town.&nbsp; George nodded, and made one
or two suggestions.&nbsp; Recommended a sailor&rsquo;s bag; there
were two in the cloakroom at the present time left by men home on
furlough; one could be emptied.&nbsp; Mr. Polsworthy, having
inspected these, made his <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>selection and, arranging concerning
the loan of an old uniform, shook hands.&nbsp; The kit-bag was
presented to George, who said he might be able to make use of
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I can say is,&rdquo; remarked the man from London,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you.&nbsp; You
shan&rsquo;t be the loser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Question is,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;how much be I
going to gain?&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call
mercenary, but I like to make a bit of money as well as
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Polsworthy seemed hurt by this view of the matter, and
taking half a sovereign from his pocket, placed it in the
other&rsquo;s hand; George said he could go on.&nbsp; Polsworthy
went on to the extent of four pounds and then stopped, declaring
irascibly that rather than go beyond this amount he would take
the entire sum back; George pointed out difficulties, one of
which included a reference to Police-Constable Saxby.&nbsp; The
amount reached five pounds, and the two again shook hands; the
heartiness was this time on the side of George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have a chance of seeing her,&rdquo; said
Polsworthy, &ldquo;keep up the idea that it&rsquo;s simply and
solely a love affair.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll make a good excuse in
case I happen to be interrupted at my work.&nbsp; Mention that I
seem to be able to talk of nothing else but her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that you worship the very ground she walks
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overdo it.&nbsp; You can say
it&rsquo;s all because of love that I&rsquo;m going to dress up
and come and see her.&nbsp; Say that from what you know of me
I&rsquo;m as true as gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As true as five pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; urged Polsworthy, with
some temper, &ldquo;do try to avoid making a muddle.&nbsp; If the
business goes wrong, I&rsquo;ll dog your footsteps to the very
last day of your life.&nbsp; If I get into trouble I shan&rsquo;t
be alone.&nbsp; Make no mistake about that.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
that slip of paper that you wrote down the particulars
on?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was produced, and the man from London, with a
snatch, secured it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;now, I&rsquo;ve got documentary evidence that you&rsquo;re
concerned in this game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother won&rsquo;t like me none the better for
this,&rdquo; said George, dismally.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
go up to the vicarage again, and give the young party your
message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polsworthy, in a uniform that had seen trouble, staggered into
the station-yard at ten o&rsquo;clock that night and was stopped
at the gates by P.C. Saxby.&nbsp; The constable apologised for
the act on seeing brass buttons, accepted the explanation that
the other was an extra hand, and offered to give help with the
sailor&rsquo;s bag, but Polsworthy said that having managed so
far alone, he would complete the job.&nbsp; In the dimly lighted
booking-hall he set his load down with relief, and <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>went to the
porters&rsquo; room, where he changed into his own clothes.&nbsp;
Ordered George to label the sack for London Bridge and, treating
him as a stranger, gave him twopence for his service.&nbsp; The
window of the office opened and he took his ticket from the
stationmaster and strolled across the line in order to be out of
the way should disaster arrive prematurely.</p>
<p>Nothing amiss happened, and when the train arrived, he climbed
into an empty compartment on the off side, and ventured to glance
out of the window to see George hurling a well-loaded sack into
the front break van.&nbsp; They exchanged a congratulatory wave
of the hand as the train went out, and George wished him, with
great heartiness, good luck, and a pleasant journey.</p>
<p>Half an hour later George was ringing at the door of the
vicarage, and playing with the watch-dog, who had followed him up
the avenue, showing some inquisitiveness in regard to the load
which George was carrying.&nbsp; Lights appeared; a head looked
out of a window; in five minutes he was being received in the
hall by the entire strength of the company in varied stages of
<i>deshabille</i>.&nbsp; The restored articles of silver were
taken out of the bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good deed,&rdquo; announced the elderly vicar,
addressing the audience, &ldquo;deserves an <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>appropriate
and immediate reward.&nbsp; My dear, run upstairs for my
pocket-book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirkell,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;run upstairs for
your master&rsquo;s pocket-book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; remarked the vicar, on the
return of the lady&rsquo;s-maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two five-pound
notes; here we are.&nbsp; George Hunt, I have much pleasure in
presenting you with this acknowledgment of worthy services.&nbsp;
My dear, give him some bread and cheese and beer, and say
good-night and thank him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirkell,&rdquo; ordered his wife, &ldquo;give him some
bread and cheese and beer, and say good-night, and thank
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Thirkell, in dressing-gown later at the side door,
promised to be at the station in the morning in time for the
first up train, and declared George had managed nicely from the
start.&nbsp; She thought it a pity there was no chance of sending
a letter to her married sister in Canada to let her know they
were coming, but George said he could afford to despatch a
telegram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that reminds me,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
s&rsquo;pose I shall have to leave ha&rsquo;f a sovereign to pay
for the other sailor&rsquo;s bag what&rsquo;s gone off with that
London gentleman.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want mother later on to get
the idea that I haven&rsquo;t behaved fair and perfectly
above-board!&rdquo;</p>

65</span>V&mdash;SURROUNDINGS</h2>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Come</span> on in!&rdquo; he
cried sportively at the window of the compartment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Plenty of room.&nbsp; Reserved for gentlemen.&nbsp; The
more the merrier!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pushed him aside in a way that showed the determined
excursionist, and the youth placed his bag on the rack and
arranged more neatly his rug and selection of cheap weekly
journals.&nbsp; The others, choosing seats, said he could now put
his head out again, and in this way frighten off other
passengers.&nbsp; Twice, before the train started, he found
himself afflicted by a short, sharp cough when girls went by in
couples, and as they looked around he lifted his cap, glancing
over his shoulder to see whether the humour was recognised and
appreciated by fellow-travellers.</p>
<p>He asked numerous questions of the harried porters, shouted
&ldquo;Move yourself!&rdquo; to folk who ran up at the last
moment, gave a loud <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>whistle to the guard and waved his arm.&nbsp; The staff
on the platform showed indications of relief as the train took
him away; he begged them to cheer up, promising to be back in
London in ten days&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I go off for my holiday in the country,&rdquo; he
remarked, going back into his corner and placing one heel on the
cushion opposite, &ldquo;I always reckon to begin enjoying myself
from the very start.&nbsp; Lose no time, is my motto.&nbsp;
Anybody object to smoking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A middle-aged man answered that he did not exactly object, but
he thought people who wanted to smoke might as well travel in a
smoking-carriage.&nbsp; Had no desire to make any unpleasantness,
but that was his view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear old University chum,&rdquo; cried the youth,
striking a match, &ldquo;I can see what&rsquo;s the matter with
you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had a row with the missus.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s been giving you a bit of her mind this morning.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s been offering a few &rsquo;ome truths, and some of
&rsquo;em still rankle.&nbsp; Now what you&rsquo;ve got to do is
to imitate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to throw off dull care and be merry
and bright.&nbsp; Give us a yarn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give us,&rdquo; retorted the middle-aged man,
testily, &ldquo;a little peace and quietness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s have a riddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll riddle you,&rdquo; threatened the man,
&ldquo;if <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>you can&rsquo;t leave off badgering.&nbsp; Talk to one
of the others.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tired of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He loves me, he loves me not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Counting the
ends of the window strap and throwing them away when the last
gave a negative reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;All my old friends seem to be
deserting me since I come into a bit of money.&nbsp; Does any one
want to borrow a five-pound note?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t all speak at
once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The compartment seemed disinclined to talk; willing, indeed,
to allow him to monopolise the conversation.&nbsp; He increased
his efforts, and presently an anecdote told concerning a lady of
his acquaintance goaded one into making the statement that the
joke had appeared in print over and over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the young blade, &ldquo;then let
somebody else have a go.&rdquo;&nbsp; Somebody else did now
accept the invitation, and ere the train was free of the last
streets of town conversation became general, and he had to raise
his voice in order to preserve for himself the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell me nothing I don&rsquo;t know
about London,&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived
there for the last three years, and I reckon I&rsquo;m more of a
Londoner than any one who was born there.&nbsp; Look &rsquo;ere;
we can soon put it to the test.&nbsp; How many comic songs of the
present day have any of you got in your repertoire?&nbsp; What
about you, uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; protested the middle-aged
man, &ldquo;I have met, in my time, a good many bounders of all
shapes and sorts and sizes, but you are the limit.&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you behave yourself quietly when you&rsquo;re in the
presence of your betters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always do,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now then,
if any one can give an imitation of George Robey, let him do it;
if not, I&rsquo;ll have a try to do the best I can.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;ll shorten the journey for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They admitted his effort was not so bad, and two or three of
his own age began to regard him enviously.&nbsp; Having regained
command, he took care not to lose it again, and by the time the
train stopped at its first junction he had secured an attentive
audience; even the middle-aged man, on the train re-starting,
asked how far he was going.&nbsp; The lad, with a glance out of
the window, said he was not yet near his destination, but
promised to give full warning when the time came near for them to
endure the wrench of saying good-bye.</p>
<p>He conquered the middle-aged man, but appeared not satisfied
with his victory, and, exercising the power of a tyrant, gave him
a nick-name and invented a description of the domestic
environments, insisting, in spite of the man&rsquo;s assertion
that he was a bachelor, on offering a lively account of the
masterful behaviour of the man&rsquo;s wife, her <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>authority
over him, his servile and penitent behaviour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A confounded young cad!&rdquo; declared the other,
heatedly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what you are.&nbsp; Most offensive
specimen I ever encountered.&nbsp; Perfect curse to
society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a daisy?&rdquo; asked the youth of the
others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a arum lily?&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t he a china ornament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him alone!&rdquo; urged one of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; he said, amiably.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a turn now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The compartment was becoming restive under his sniping, when
some one caught the name of a station as the train flew past, and
the lad, saying, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know we were so
near,&rdquo; rose and took his bag from the rack.&nbsp; Letting
the window down and resting his chin there, he inhaled the
country air, and announced, with a change of tone, identification
of certain houses and meadows.&nbsp; That was the place where he
once knocked up thirty-eight, after making a duck&rsquo;s-egg in
the first innings; here was the very finest wood for nutting in
the whole neighbourhood; over there, if you only went late enough
and not too late, you could pick more blackberries than you cared
to carry away.&nbsp; He begged them all to rise to catch sight of
the spire of a church; they had to jump up again to see the
thatched roof of a farm where lived, <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>he declared, three of the best
cousins in the whole world.&nbsp; He packed his cap in the bag,
put on a bowler, and threw away the end of his cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope I haven&rsquo;t been talking too much,&rdquo; he
said, apologetically, &ldquo;and I trust no offence has been
taken where none was intended.&nbsp; Just look at that clump of
trees over there, and notice the colours they&rsquo;ve got;
aren&rsquo;t they simply wonderful?&nbsp; What were you going to
say, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The middle-aged man hazarded the opinion that Nature knew
something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes you realise,&rdquo; admitted the youth soberly,
&ldquo;when you get down into the country, that some one else
besides man has had to do with the making of the world.&nbsp; If
you gentlemen don&rsquo;t mind coming over here, you&rsquo;ll be
able to catch a glimpse of where my mother and my sister
live.&nbsp; There!&rdquo; he cried exultantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
just saw it, didn&rsquo;t you, between the trees.&nbsp; Smoke
coming out of the chimney.&nbsp; That means&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
He pressed his hand against his under-lip.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
means they&rsquo;re preparing.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no idea what a
lot they think of me.&nbsp; If they&rsquo;re at the station,
you&rsquo;ll have a chance of seeing them.&nbsp; Goodbye
all.&nbsp; Hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy yourselves as much as
I&rsquo;m going to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped out before the train ceased to move, and looked up
and down the platform <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>with eagerness and some
anxiety.&nbsp; An elderly woman in black and a short girl waved
excitedly to him from the inside of the doorway of the
booking-office; he ran across, and, dropping the bag, kissed them
affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear, dear blessing!&rdquo; cried the mother.</p>

75</span>VI&mdash;RETIRING INSPECTOR</h2>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span><span
class="smcap">Inspector Richards</span> mentioned to several of
the staff that, whilst he had often taken part in the
presentation of testimonials, he specially wished that no tribute
of a valuable nature should be paid to him on his retirement, and
the men, after private consideration, took him at his word.&nbsp;
The night of his departure was the occasion, nevertheless, for
many touching incidents.&nbsp; Inspector Richards made a point of
shaking hands with all those inferior to him in position; a
compliment they accepted shyly, after rubbing the palm down the
side of trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always been my desire,&rdquo; he said benevolently,
&ldquo;to treat every one alike, and I trust I&rsquo;ve
succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it, sir.&nbsp; No mistake about
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I have never shown anything in the shape of
favouritism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There again, sir, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;I am anxious to express the desire that nothing
but what I may call kindly thoughts will be entertained
concerning me when I leave the duties I have so long carried
out,&rdquo; said Inspector Richards elaborately, &ldquo;and
there&rsquo;s no objection to you mentioning it, as freely as you
like, that I shall be glad to see old friends at any hour, and
any time, from half-past eight in the morning till eleven
o&rsquo;clock o&rsquo; night at three-two-seven, Hampstead
Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few of the junior members were under the impression that the
words suggested liberal and cheerful hospitality; those who knew
Mr. Richards better warned them not to expect too much from old
T. R.&nbsp; T. R., they said, had never yet given away a
ha&rsquo;porth of anything, and acquaintance with human nature
induced them to believe that he, at his age, was not likely to
begin.&nbsp; The one person who had known T. R. the longest found
herself swiftly disillusioned.&nbsp; Harriet was to live with her
father over the shop in Hampstead Road, and to keep house for
him; her wedding was to take place when Mr. Richards found it
possible to make other arrangements, and not until then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall look after the shop,&rdquo; he said
commandingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my part of the
work.&nbsp; All you&rsquo;ve got to do is to see to the cooking,
and the cleaning up, the <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>washing on Mondays, the ironing later
on, the boots, the garden at the back, and so on and so
forth.&nbsp; You sweep out the shop first thing in the morning,
but apart from that, you&rsquo;re not to show your face
there.&nbsp; Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me the trouble of speaking
twice,&rdquo; he went on in his official manner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been used to managing much bigger affairs,
without any trouble, and this will be mere child&rsquo;s
play.&nbsp; I look on it more as a hobby than anything
else.&nbsp; Worst thing that can happen to a man of my
industrious nature is to have nothing to occupy his mind.&nbsp;
Go in now, and don&rsquo;t you ever dare come out &rsquo;less I
call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shop opened promptly on the first morning, Mr. Richards
wearing a silk hat as he took down the shutters, to indicate that
shirt-sleeves did not mean inferiority.&nbsp; He nodded distantly
to his neighbours, and when they asked him a question concerning
the weather of the day shook his head reservedly to convey the
idea that he had not yet decided the point.&nbsp; Inside, he
arranged the cash-drawer neatly and prepared change, blew a speck
of dust from the counter, and, replacing the silk hat with a grey
tweed cap, lighted a pipe and waited for the rush of
custom.&nbsp; A drawback of official life had consisted in the
fact that one could <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>not be seen smoking within a certain distance of the
terminus; it had been his duty on many occasions to reprove the
staff for indulging in a pipe at the wrong moment, or at the
inappropriate place; the match which he struck on the sole of his
slippers made a bright flaming signal of the inauguration of
liberty.&nbsp; During the morning Mr. Richards struck many
matches and smoked several pipes, so that at one o&rsquo;clock
when his daughter called out respectfully, &ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s
ready, father!&rdquo; his appetite was not so good as, at this
hour, it should have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a morning has it been, father?&rdquo;
asked Harriet, with deference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your own business,&rdquo; he retorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And pull the muslin curtain aside so that I can see when
any one comes in.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve told you before the
shop&rsquo;s nothing to do with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lad rapping at the counter,&rdquo; she
remarked, disregarding his orders.</p>
<p>Mr. Richards upset his chair in the anxiety to attend to his
first customer, and hurried in, wiping his mouth with the back of
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do?&rdquo; said the lad familiarly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How you getting on at your new job?&nbsp; Settling down
all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, Jenkinson?&rdquo; Richards
rested the tips of his fingers on the counter and beamed
across.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tobacco or cigarettes?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>&ldquo;Last time me and you held conversation
together,&rdquo; remarked the lad&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking
now of a matter of six weeks ago, or it might be a couple of
months&mdash;you distinctly told me, as far as I remember, that
smoking at my time of life was playing the deuce with my
health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s good if taken in
moderation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, furthermore, you said that if you caught me with a
fag again, you&rsquo;d report me to headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My humour is what they call dry,&rdquo; urged
Richards.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have to go below the surface to see
what I&rsquo;m really driving at.&nbsp; How are they managing at
the old place?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the new inspector like?&nbsp;
Some of you will find a difference, if I&rsquo;m not greatly
mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General opinion,&rdquo; said the lad, with marked
emphasis, &ldquo;seems to be that this one is a
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Richards eyed him across the counter; the other, almost
quailing, asked whether the establishment included matches
amongst its stores.&nbsp; A box being produced, he inquired how
many it contained.&nbsp; Mr. Richards said he did not know.&nbsp;
The lad, opening the box, remarked that it appeared to have been
tampered with, and expressed a desire not <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>to be
swindled.&nbsp; The proprietor imperatively ordered him to go out
of the shop, and went back to his meal.&nbsp; This had become
cold; the circumstance that he himself was considerably heated
did not compensate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another!&rdquo; mentioned Harriet.</p>
<p>A lamp-boy, bearing on his features evidence of occupation,
wished to make an inquiry, and, accepting the reply, stayed to
argue that tin-tacks were a necessity to many people at many
times and should therefore be kept by those who desired to serve
the public; he went on to give a brief lecture on the laws of
supply and demand, and, this finished, seemed unwilling to leave
without confessing something in the way of patronage, and Mr.
Richards found himself called upon to give two halfpennies in
exchange for a penny and to say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to an
individual whom he had not, in official days, condescended to
notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must put some brains into it,&rdquo; counselled the
boy, before going out of the doorway.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
your only chance.&nbsp; Competition&rsquo;s very keen at the
present time.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t forget civility.&nbsp;
Civility goes a long way with a lot of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your hand away from that new paint!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to identify customers by
finger-marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have any if you don&rsquo;t treat
&rsquo;em properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>&ldquo;Go back to the station,&rdquo; roared Mr.
Richards, &ldquo;and give them features of yours a good
wash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Used soap and water just before I came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then get them to turn the hose on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy tried to think of a retort, but none came.&nbsp; He
made a face and went.</p>
<p>That evening, at half-past six, saw the real start of
business.&nbsp; In less than five minutes the shop filled with
customers, all talking loudly, all demanding to be served at
once, but, in spite of this, making no attempt to leave
quickly.&nbsp; More than once in the flurry and bustle of taking
money&mdash;it was the night of pay-day, and much change
therefore required&mdash;he called upstairs to inquire whether
Harriet&rsquo;s young man had arrived; the last answer received
was to the effect that the youth in question had been told not to
come round that evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you to say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it best, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made an appeal to the customers for sympathy on the grounds
that he had a fool for a daughter.&nbsp; They asked what else he
had a right to expect.</p>
<p>It was satisfactory to see the shop crowded, but he wished the
deportment had been of a more careful nature.&nbsp; Some called
him Richards, quite shortly; a porter, for whom <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>it had been
his painful duty to obtain three days&rsquo; suspension, referred
to him more familiarly; and the retired inspector found, as many
have discovered, that few of us in London, however important,
escape a nickname.&nbsp; A few in sportive mood endeavoured to
confuse him over the coins tendered, and when he had to beg one
to go out and obtain some small silver for a sovereign, the
messenger prolonged absence to such an extent that Mr. Richards
became seriously alarmed, refusing to consider the bets offered
concerning the possibility of the man never being heard of
again.&nbsp; Temper was exhibited when the messenger returned
with eighty threepenny-pieces, obtained from a friend connected
with a chapel; and when it was pointed out that folk had a
prejudice against accepting these, prompt answer came to the
effect that in future Richards had better run errands for
himself.&nbsp; A mouth-organ started a tune in a corner, and a
porter solicited the favour of a labeller&rsquo;s hand for a
dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to have that noise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They explained that it was not noise, but music.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatever it is, I&rsquo;m not going to have it.&nbsp; Put
a stop to it at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, old man, you&rsquo;re out of uniform
now.&nbsp; None of your gold-braid behaviour, if you
please.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s gone and done with.&nbsp; All change
is the motto.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
to be a nuisance to my neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gave up, with reluctance, the idea of frivolous
entertainment, and went on to the discussion of political
matters.&nbsp; Richards had prided himself on the definite nature
of his opinions concerning affairs of the nation, and even
intimate colleagues rarely ventured to disagree; he reminded
himself now that a shopkeeper had to be extremely careful to show
impartiality, and to be cautious not to give offence.&nbsp;
Consequently he found that many cherished views had to go;
appealed to when the debate became warm, he said there was a good
deal to be said on both sides; you found good and bad in
everybody; seemed to him you might say in general of politicians
that they were six of one and half-dozen of the other.&nbsp; In
preparing to go, the customers declared they would not give a
brass button for a man who was unable to make up his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look in again soon,&rdquo; he said, with a determined
effort at cordiality.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come to-morrow evening, if
you&rsquo;re doing nothing else.&nbsp; Always glad to see
you.&nbsp; No friends like the old ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He relaxed the usual attitude towards his daughter, and said
that if she felt certain hers was a case of genuine affection,
and not a mere idle fancy, he had no objection <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>to the young
man looking in any evening, every evening in fact, at about
half-past six.&nbsp; Harriet promised to convey the permission,
although she could not be sure that Arthur would take advantage
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him he can stay on to supper,&rdquo; recommended
her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might influence him,&rdquo; admitted
Harriet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you like me to give a hand with the
shop when you&rsquo;re so busy as you were to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many more times am I to tell you that I can manage
the business myself?&nbsp; Besides, I don&rsquo;t want a set of
young men coming in just for the sake of chatting and talking
with you.&nbsp; What do you think your poor mother would have
said to such an idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man on arriving the next night found a hearty
hand-shake awaiting him, and an American cigarette.&nbsp; He was
ordered to sit inside the counter and to have a good look
around.&nbsp; Mr. Richards gave something like a lesson in
geography, pointing out that Log Cabin was bordered on the east
by Navy Cut, on the west by Honey Dew; that twopenny cigars were
situated on a peninsula, and wax matches formed a range of
mountains.&nbsp; Proceeding to the cash drawers, Arthur was
instructed to observe that four separate lakes existed, each with
its own duty, and one was not on any account to be <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>confused with
the rest.&nbsp; When he exhibited a desire to go in and see
Harriet, Mr. Richards upbraided him for want of attention, and
mentioned that all knowledge was worth acquiring, in that you
never knew when it might prove useful; to retain him until the
rush of business came many reminiscent anecdotes were told of
railway life, incidents of difficulty faced by Inspector Richards
at various periods, and always triumphantly overcome.&nbsp;
Coming to more recent occurrences, a complaint was made that
Harriet that morning going out to shop in High Street had been
absent for no less than three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go in there!&rdquo; said a voice at the
doorway.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s old T. R.&rsquo;s show.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s go on higher up.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll only try to boss
it over us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Harriet sang out an announcement concerning the meal, the
proprietor of the tobacconist&rsquo;s shop remarked brusquely
that there was probably enough for two, but not sufficient for
three, and in these circumstances he would not trouble Arthur to
stay.</p>
<p>Mr. Richards was still watching the roadway, and wondering how
it was possible for so many folk to pass by an attractive
shop-window without stopping to give it the compliment of a
glance, when he caught sight of one of his fellow-inspectors on
the opposite side.&nbsp; Anxious for congenial company, he <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>gave an
invitation with a wave of the hand, and the other, after a moment
of thought, crossed over.&nbsp; Harriet made another deferential
announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time!&rdquo; he cried genially.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come along inside, Wilkinson, and share
pot-luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call pot-luck?&rdquo; inquired Wilkinson,
with caution.&nbsp; Mr. Richards recited the brief menu, and the
inspector decided to enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brought a friend,&rdquo; said Richards to his daughter
in the back parlour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we shall want a fourth chair, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Wilkinson, sit you down and
make yourself thoroughly at home.&nbsp; How are you muddling on
without me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting on first class,&rdquo; announced
Wilkinson, his eyes on Harriet, but his words addressed to her
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some of them were saying only this evening
that it just proved how much could be done by kindness.&nbsp;
There hasn&rsquo;t been a cross word since you left, and not a
single member of the staff has had to be reported.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll all have a nice job later on,&rdquo; he
prophesied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let them get slack and out of control,
and it&rsquo;ll take you months to get &rsquo;em well in hand
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>&ldquo;How do you like the change, Miss?&rdquo; asked
Wilkinson, accepting the offer of lettuce.&nbsp; &ldquo;How does
business life suit you, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to do with her!&rdquo; interrupted her father
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;All she&rsquo;s responsible for is
household duties.&nbsp; I believe in women keeping to their
proper sphere.&nbsp; Once they come out of it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The change hasn&rsquo;t improved your temper, old
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped in the act of helping himself to mustard, and
stared at his late colleague.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; he said, in
a dazed way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me, got a temper?&nbsp; Well, upon my
word, we live and learn.&nbsp; This is news!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty stale to other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I venture to challenge that statement,&rdquo; said
Richards hotly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like to have a decision on
the point by some independent authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet, appealed to and ordered to speak without fear or
favour, said she wanted to know why Arthur was sent away.&nbsp;
The answer was to the effect if she had finished gorging herself
with food, she could go upstairs and leave her father and his
friend to discuss matters which her youth and sex prevented her
from understanding.&nbsp; Harriet had not completed her share of
the meal, but she obeyed at once.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to bring up a child,&rdquo;
said Richards, with a jerk of the head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
only got to give her a hint.&nbsp; Wonderful control I
exercise.&nbsp; I give my orders; she carries &rsquo;em
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem overwhelmed with customers,&rdquo;
remarked the visitor, looking through the glass portion of the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They either come with a run,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only go,&rdquo; went on Wilkinson, &ldquo;by what
I&rsquo;ve heard at the station.&nbsp; They came here once for
the lark of the thing, but the notion seems to be that once is
plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; ejaculated the ex-inspector bitterly,
&ldquo;that, I suppose, is what they call <i>esprit de
corps</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call getting their own
back.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t want to discourage you, and I
should like you to believe that I&rsquo;m saying it only for your
own good, but it&rsquo;s pretty clear to my mind that, in regard
to this tobacconist&rsquo;s business, you&rsquo;re going to lose
your little all.&nbsp; The savings of a lifetime are going to
vanish like smoke, or rather not like smoke, but into thin
air.&nbsp; Unless,&rdquo; added Wilkinson
impressively&mdash;&ldquo;unless you act wisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I always act wisely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilkinson shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;The best of us are
liable to make mistakes,&rdquo; he said <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>diplomatically, &ldquo;and consequently you&rsquo;re
more liable than most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Richards failed in the attempt to make a knife balance on
a fork, and sighed deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here now for&mdash;how long?&mdash;and
there hasn&rsquo;t been a single, solitary ring of the
bell,&rdquo; went on Wilkinson.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to
look the facts squarely in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the worst comes to the worst,&rdquo; announced the
other grimly, &ldquo;I shall sell the business and the goodwill
and stock and everything, and embark on something entirely
fresh&mdash;something where I shan&rsquo;t be dependent on the
kindness of old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a big price for the goodwill,&rdquo;
mentioned the visitor, with sarcasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I suppose
you&rsquo;ve taken the premises on a lease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me fetch you a cigar,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Richards
desperately, &ldquo;and then you give me the best advice that
lays in your power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick out one that I can smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilkinson&rsquo;s counsel, given after he had submitted the
cigar to a sufficient test, was this.&nbsp; Competition, brisk
and determined, existed in the trade on the part of large firms
who opened shops all over the place.&nbsp; Small establishments
could only exist by the possession of something in the shape of
what Wilkinson called a magnet&mdash;a magnet to draw the people
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean a gramophone?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>Wilkinson meant nothing of the kind.&nbsp; What you had
to bear in mind was, first, that all your possible customers
belonged to what was known as the male persuasion; second, that
by an old-established arrangement, which you might argue against
but you had to accept, the male was always attracted by the
female.&nbsp; Wilkinson added that in his opinion the daughter
upstairs was a dashed good-looking girl, and, the cigar being
near to its end, suggested that another might be presented to
bear him company on the way home.&nbsp; And went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harriet, my girl,&rdquo; said Mr. Richards,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of an idea that I may as well mention
at once before I forget it.&nbsp; No doubt you&rsquo;ve heard the
remark about Satan and idle hands.&nbsp; And as there&rsquo;s no
good reason why I should work my fingers to the bone, I shall
want you to come into the shop of an afternoon and evening, and
serve customers, and smile at &rsquo;em, and make yourself
generally useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid you&rsquo;re too late, father,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you had let Arthur stay to supper, we were
not going to tell you anything about it.&nbsp; As it is,
you&rsquo;ve got to be told that we were married this morning at
the registrar&rsquo;s, and that I&rsquo;m going to leave you
now.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The shop is doing very well, and when you <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>happen to
pass that way, you might step in and buy something.&nbsp; You
will find Harriet at the counter serving goods of excellent
quality at current prices; in the evening her husband is also
there.&nbsp; Glancing through the windowed door of the shop
parlour, you may catch sight of ex-Inspector Richards, looking
after the baby.</p>
<h2><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>VII&mdash;THE USURPER</h2>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span><span
class="smcap">He</span> told some friends whom he caught up on
the way that his was a position of pretty middling tidy
responsibility, and when he spoke more freely on the topic they
gave a whistle which conveyed an amount of astonishment that
proved gratifying.&nbsp; The lad explained to each in turn that
his mother was an uncommonly good manager, able to make a penny
go as far as some could use a shilling; each made the identical
reply before selecting a turning on the right of Kingsland Road,
that it must nevertheless be a close fit, and added, &ldquo;Stick
to it, old man; wish you better luck,&rdquo; with all the
solemnity and earnestness of boys who have but recently started
work.&nbsp; One or two acquaintances shouted to him from the tops
of electric trams, flying Stamford Hill way, indicating by signs
the existence of a vacant seat; he shook his head and marched
on.&nbsp; Three girls, making their way home by a series of
spasmodic rushes, with <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>at intervals hysterical appeals to
each other not to act the silly (being, in fact, so delighted at
release from work that they scarcely knew how to make
proclamation of their happiness)&mdash;these snatched at his cap
and, a few yards off, threw it back to him, taking at once to
their heels, and later becoming extremely indignant because he
had not respected the rules of the game by chasing them and
administering punishment in the shape of a blow on the
shoulder.&nbsp; Their annoyance at his reticent manner was so
great that they presently waited, demanding of him when he
arrived whether he thought himself everybody.&nbsp; Failing to
obtain an answer, they furnished estimates on their own account,
asserting (by happy choice of words) that he was deaf, dumb, or
dotty; he did not trouble to contradict, and they gave him
up.&nbsp; Nearing home, he increased his frown of importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Tommy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thomas,&rsquo; if you please,&rdquo; he said,
bending to kiss the child; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t let me catch
you again swinging on this gate.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have the
whole row of palings down, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll be
doing.&nbsp; Big, clumsy girl like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngster, gratified by this compliment, took his hand,
and led him to the front door, where she cried
&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; with a strong accent on the second
syllable; on gaining a reply of &ldquo;Now begin your nonsense <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>again,&rdquo;
she announced the arrival.&nbsp; The boy hung his cap behind the
door, and threw himself into an easy chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, with an exhausted air, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t play games with you this evening.&nbsp; Yes, yes, I
know I used to; but them times are all past and gone.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re too young to understand, my girl, and it&rsquo;s as
well you are, but life&rsquo;s a serious matter.&nbsp; Tell me,
how&rsquo;ve you been getting on at school to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teacher give me a rap over the knuckles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it, neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I mean is,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that a little
girl like you ought to do her best to learn all she can whilst
she&rsquo;s got the opportunities.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, why,
later on, when it&rsquo;s too late, you&rsquo;ll be sorry.&nbsp;
In the meantime, you want to do all you can to pick up everything
at school, and not give your teachers opportunity for being cross
with you in any shape or form whatsoever.&nbsp; You hear what
I&rsquo;m telling you.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s mother singing
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put this top somewhere,&rdquo; suggested the child,
&ldquo;whilst I turn my face to the wall&mdash;I won&rsquo;t
look, truth and honour&mdash;and then you tell me when I&rsquo;m
getting warm and when I&rsquo;m getting cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear you spell it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>The
little person, found guilty of spelling top with two p&rsquo;s,
not only had to accept a severe reprimand, but was called upon to
spell pot, and pop, and one or two other words; when she had gone
through the examination the boy agreed to conceal the article,
and she set about with great enthusiasm on the task of finding
it, but the game was so frequently interfered with by his
admonitions concerning present behaviour, by warnings regarding
future conduct, that she did not hide her satisfaction when the
mother brought in his tea.&nbsp; The child was allowed to stand
by and receive the top of the egg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted the mother, in answer to his
challenge, &ldquo;I am in rather good spirits.&nbsp; Would you
like a second cup, Tommy, or another slice of bread and
butter?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve only to say the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are not times,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;for a
man to make a hog of himself.&nbsp; You must arrange for the
money to last as long as it possibly can, mother.&nbsp; Watch
every penny.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let there be nothing in the shape
of waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I managed, my dear,&rdquo; she retorted, with spirit,
&ldquo;when your father was in work, and earning 35s. a week, and
I&rsquo;ve somehow managed during the last six weeks on your
money alone.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s took a bit of doing,&rdquo; she
sighed, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set down and rest for a moment,&rdquo; <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>recommended
the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Expect you&rsquo;re like
me&mdash;you&rsquo;ve had a hard day of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl was expelled from the room for the reason that
her mother, in sitting, found the concealed wooden top.&nbsp; The
two were left to converse together; the boy found a crumpled
cigarette in his pocket, and his mother, hunting for matches,
sang the first lines of a song that belonged to her early
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no objection,&rdquo; he said, speaking
with deliberation, between the puffs, &ldquo;to you being
light-&rsquo;earted, but I hope you realise, mother, that
I&rsquo;m having to stint myself pretty considerably in order
that you should make both ends meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good lad,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;as
lads go nowadays!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deny myself several luxuries, such as the first
&rsquo;ouse at the local Empire, something extra for lunch, a new
necktie for Sundays.&nbsp; This fag that I&rsquo;m smoking at the
present moment was given to me.&nbsp; I bring &rsquo;ome every
penny I earn, and if I &rsquo;appen by any chance to make a bit
extra, why, I bring that &rsquo;ome as well.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
begrudge it in the least; shouldn&rsquo;t like you to think that
of me, mother; all I want you to do is to recognise it.&nbsp; And
if you care to mention the fact to neighbours, or friends, or
even to relatives, why, there&rsquo;s no objection on my
part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never made no secret of it, my <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>dear,&rdquo; she declared, reassuringly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your Aunt Mary was in only this afternoon, and you know
what an inquisitive one she is.&nbsp; She brings a small pot of
jam, and always expects about a ton of information in
exchange.&nbsp; Wanted to know how I managed, and whether we was
running into debt, and how long it was likely to last, and I
don&rsquo;t know what all.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t tell her
everything, but I did mention that if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
you I don&rsquo;t know where we should have found
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said I ought to be proud of you.&nbsp; Said she wished
she had a son like you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He nodded approvingly, and
continued to listen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Said that, considering you only
left school seven months ago&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;you might reckon yourself a credit to the
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all she said about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stretched himself, enjoying luxuriously the end of his
cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; going on with relish, &ldquo;I was able to
take her down a peg before she went.&nbsp; Never said nothing
about it until just as she was going, and then I told her, what
I&rsquo;m now going to tell you, my dear, and that is this: your
father&rsquo;s been taken back by his old firm, and he started
earning good <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>money this very day.&nbsp; Wherever are you off to in
such a hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy snatched his cap from the wooden peg.&nbsp; He strode
out by the front door, and walked away towards Dalston Junction,
frowning.</p>

105</span>VIII&mdash;JULES ZWINGER</h2>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> probability is that, if you arrive by
train and see first the Restaurant of the Station, you will stay
at Zwinger&rsquo;s; if you come into the town by road, crossing
the bridge that spans the harbour, and see first the Restaurant
of Zwinger, you will put up at the Restaurant of the Station.</p>
<p>Assuming that you stay at Zwinger&rsquo;s, this is what
happens.&nbsp; The carrier of your bag (who looks like a
fisherman, and walks as a fisherman, but is not a fisherman)
throws it down outside the restaurant, and, sinking on one of the
green iron chairs, groans aloud a protest against the scheme by
which one has to work ere one can gain five pence; he rolls a
cigarette of black tobacco, and strikes a match which makes other
customers choke and cough.&nbsp; Then comes, leisurely, one of
the Misses Zwinger, accepting salutations with the austere air of
a lady bored by deference.&nbsp; Miss Zwinger, without asking the
desires or <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>wishes of the new arrival, engages in swift and shrill
altercation with a dog, hitherto inoffensive, and occupied with
the duties of explorer at the kerb; the dog goes, but, at a safe
distance, expresses an opinion by four sharp barks, that bring
from every corner of the triangular market-place, and especially
from the Town Hall at the base, several dogs, to whom he explains
the grievance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You require?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Zwinger calls her sister from the sanded floor interior
to help with the task of fending off an insurgent boarder.&nbsp;
The restaurant is full; you may be able to engage a furnished
room opposite; why not go to the hotel out in the forest?&nbsp;
It is preferred, at this season, to take only those who wish to
stay for a month; would a double-bedded room suit?&nbsp; Finally,
having finished the duet, they leave, with a twirl of skirts,
giving the centre of the stage, so to speak, to a short, grim,
black-capped man who, hands deep in trousers pockets, talks as
one giving an imitation of distant thunder.&nbsp; Outside clients
rise from their chairs, inside customers put down ribald journals
with pictures intended to be amusing, and stroll out to enjoy
themselves.&nbsp; Here comes the final test of the novice.</p>
<p>I have seen young couples, husbands and wives, or brothers and
sisters, come from the narrow lane and, recognising
Zwinger&rsquo;s, say instantly:</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&nbsp; This will never
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others (and these especially when ladies have been of the
party) retire after the contest with the Misses Zwinger.&nbsp;
Some, enduring this encounter, turn and run, trembling and
affrighted, on being faced by the uncompromising host
himself.&nbsp; A few (mostly artists) survive all of the dangers,
and are grudgingly permitted to carry their bags up a narrow
wooden staircase, and find a room, the number of which has been
screamed at them: in the room they discover a milk jug nearly
half-full of water, and a small damp piece of linen riding on the
clothes-horse.&nbsp; Apart from these defects, I will say that
Zwinger&rsquo;s, once conquered, gives in, so far as bedroom and
meals are concerned, with a fairly good grace.</p>
<p>Dinner in the large room at the back (entrance gained by way
of the kitchen) is a good, sufficient meal, to which it is only
necessary to bring the appetite to be gained by wandering in the
woods, or a brisk ride in tramcars from the sea.&nbsp; Framed
paintings on the wall, and paintings on the wall with no frames,
some a trifle obscured by age, and possessing the signatures of
men no longer youthful.&nbsp; Four tables up and down the room;
the table on the right reserved for a set of young women who, at
the beginning of the evening meal, talk so persistently of the
contributions they have made during the day to <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>the art of
England and America, that one&rsquo;s French neighbour, with
serviette tucked in at throat, can, I fear, scarcely hear himself
eat his soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most awfully pleased with what I&rsquo;ve done
to-day.&nbsp; If the light hadn&rsquo;t begun to go
off&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m like that, too.&nbsp; Sometimes I simply
can&rsquo;t do anything, and then, another time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, the model was too comic for words.&nbsp;
Talking all the time.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d only understood what he
was saying, I could write a book about him, and that&rsquo;s a
fact!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely in love with the place.&nbsp; Could stay
here for a whole week, only I must be getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serving of the meal has a touch of over-emphasis that
sometimes startles those who possess nerves; after a while, one
becomes accustomed to the method of banging each dish on the
table with a clatter.&nbsp; It is no exaggeration, but the mere
truth to say that, a request being made for more bread, a chunk
is cut from the yard-long loaves and thrown at the diner; with
practice, a certain dexterity can be gained, especially by those
expert in the cricket-field.&nbsp; Five courses to the meal, and
now and again between two, a considerable interval, whilst the
Zwinger family and its dependents have a row in the kitchen, the
guests sitting back patiently until the last word is
uttered.&nbsp; The nice question <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>of allotting this last word is not
easy to decide, for when the rumbling bass of Zwinger has fired
what appears to be a parting shot, and the girls return to the
dining-room with plates, and guests pull chairs forward, one of
the young women may think of another argument, and the two go
back to the kitchen, where the dispute recommences.&nbsp; The
quarrel finally at an end, the Zwinger ladies come in, scarlet as
a result of animated discussion, and they serve the next course
with more than usual truculence.&nbsp; Boarders go outside to
take their coffee and to smoke, eyed narrowly, as they pass
through, by Zwinger, to be joined at tables on the pavement by
wonderful youths in corduroy suits, which suggest that they are
either artists with a definite aim in life, or porters belonging
to the railway of the North.</p>
<p>You can always tell at Zwinger&rsquo;s a new arrival by the
circumstance that, after taking some thought in regard to the
arrangement and wording of the phrase, he advances to the
counter, where Zwinger scowls in a manner that excuses the
acidity of contents of some of the bottles ranged there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes good weather,&rdquo; remarks the new arrival,
cheerily.</p>
<p>Zwinger replies with an ejaculated grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the world here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zwinger&mdash;a most difficult speaker to report with
accuracy&mdash;says something like &ldquo;S-s-t!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;If you will have the kindness to give me a good
cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zwinger pushes a box forward, and the perplexed new arrival,
tempted, I am sure, to fall back on Ollendorf, and to ask for the
new inkstand of his great-uncle, refrains from further speech,
and tempts the fates by making selection from the compartment
marked 15 c.&nbsp; Outside he, on explaining his grievance,
ascertains that there is no need to feel specially dishonoured by
the gruffness accorded to him.&nbsp; Zwinger must not be
considered with the eye that one gives to, say, the manager of
the Carlton away in London.&nbsp; Zwinger (declare the hopeful)
may be right enough once you get to know him.&nbsp; Zwinger
(admit the candid) is certainly trying, but you have to put up
with something in coming to a quiet place of this kind.&nbsp; The
tramcars clang, and hoot, and screw across the market-place, and
provide a more pleasing subject for conversation.</p>
<p>Disappearance of the curfew bell might have been coincident
with the entry of Zwinger into public life.&nbsp; At a quarter
past ten, he shows signs of restlessness, jerking commands to the
long man-servant, keeping at the doorway a keen eye on the round
tables.&nbsp; As each becomes free, Zwinger orders it, with its
chairs, to be taken inside, and, although he permits himself to
exhibit no signs of gratification, I am certain he feels secretly
<a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>pleased
when small parties of young men come across, and, finding no
place, give up their original intention.&nbsp; If they endeavour
to pass through the doorway, Zwinger, taking no notice of them,
remains there so stolidly that they are compelled to take notice
of him.&nbsp; I have seen him snatch newspapers from the hands of
those who appeared disinclined to observe the face of the clock:
I have observed him give a hint to an occupied chair by kicking
it.&nbsp; He turns down the lights, one by one.&nbsp; In
desperate cases, where a couple of young Englishmen, with the
conventional ideas of the licence enjoyed at restaurants abroad,
fill a fresh pipe, I have seen him take a broom, and, with a few
resolute strokes, send them choking and half-blinded from the
restaurant.&nbsp; When a late-stayer, with an idea of making a
good and amiable exit, says, in departing, &ldquo;Good-night to
the company!&rdquo; Zwinger responds with one of those grunts not
to be found in any French or English dictionary.&nbsp; Every one
gone, he takes a black cigar from the case, orders the girls to
go to bed, and, at the doorway, stands a good half-hour in order
to enjoy the satisfaction of saying, when any one arrives,
&ldquo;Closed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bad luck for any resident who returns so late that Zwinger has
retired to rest.&nbsp; For him, the restaurant presents no light,
and, if he cares to be well-advised, he will give up the attempt
at once and spend the hours on <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>the bridge, smelling the tide, and
watching the flashlight that sweeps round from a point on the
coast.&nbsp; Should he prove obstinate, and persist in knocking,
he is engaged on a lengthy sport; the worst thing that can happen
is that Zwinger himself, and not the long man-servant, should
come down presently to give admission.&nbsp; Cheerful blades
have, ere this, on the door being opened, tried to meet Zwinger
with a pleasantry, affecting to have brought the milk, or giving
an imitation of the crowing of a cock, but a look from Zwinger
arrests.&nbsp; Others, less daring and more diplomatic, rush
past, snatch their candlestick from the counter, and vanish with
the celerity easy to those possessed by sudden fear; the next
morning they go out by the side door, take a roundabout route to
gain the other side of the market-place, cross the bridge, and
hide in the forest.&nbsp; There is a report (which some credit,
but I do not) of one young man, leaving after a stay of six
weeks, during which time the proprietor exchanged no word with
him; in going, he suddenly dropped his kit bag, seized Zwinger by
the hand, wrung the hand with enthusiasm for the space of nearly
a minute, thanking the astonished Zwinger the while for great
amiability and kindness, and genial behaviour; expressing a
fervent hope that Zwinger, when visiting Chelsea, would not fail
to call at the Art Club in Church Street.&nbsp; The statement is
that <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>this was done for a bet.&nbsp; Those who assume it to
be true are forced to admit that France, with all its stirring
history, has rarely seen a braver act.</p>
<p>Yet I, who write these words, have seen the proprietor for one
whole day change his outlook, reverse his manner, alter his
deportment.&nbsp; The day came rather late in the season, and
nearly every one had left, but corroborative evidence can be
called if necessary.&nbsp; The night before, a hint, broad
without being deep, was given by the Misses Zwinger to the effect
that no guarantee existed that meals would be provided on the
day: they pointed out the example which would be adopted by some
other boarders, of catching the 10.23 in the morning to a
neighbouring town, returning in the evening by the 9.48.&nbsp;
Throughout the night, from half-past ten until an hour I am
unable to fix, the noise of sawing, the thud of hammer and nails,
went on in the restaurant, with all the usual arguments that
arise when carpentry has to be done.&nbsp; Clatter and
contention, bustle and loud voices; Zwinger, himself, growling
now and again to express dissatisfaction with everything.&nbsp; I
remember that, by the device of making sympathetic inquiries
after rheumatism, it was possible in the morning to get from cook
a roll and a cup of coffee, and to escape from the din, which had
recommenced, through the convenient side door, and jump <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>on the last
carriage of a tram-train that went out to the sea.&nbsp; At one
o&rsquo;clock, the return.</p>
<p>A crowd outside Zwinger&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A crowd made up of
frock-coated men, with red ribbon in buttonhole; men in full
evening dress, silk hats (some of which appeared, from their
shapes, to be the results of investments in the &rsquo;eighties),
a few bowler hats coming well down to the ears; boots, in certain
instances, shining and pointed, in others more substantial, with
dust collected from high-roads.&nbsp; Much lifting of these silk
hats and these bowlers, with extraordinary deference on the part
of many, beaming condescension on the part of the rest; an
evident desire with the prosperous to set the remainder at their
ease.&nbsp; Inside the restaurant, long tables set on trestles,
that accounted for the turbulent proceedings which had broken the
night, flowers in every spare mug, vase, or glass: flags
dependent from the ceiling; the Misses Zwinger, costumed as
though about to run on in musical comedy.&nbsp; Through the
kitchen came, pulling his white tie, and pushing in one side of a
shirt-front that immediately bulged out on the other side,
Zwinger himself.&nbsp; A new Zwinger, a Zwinger I had never seen
before, a smile in every crease of his features, saluting me with
a light, friendly touch on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What magnificent weather!&nbsp; Ah, how fortunate we
are!&nbsp; Monsieur will do us the <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>honour to sit down with us?&nbsp;
But yes.&nbsp; I count upon you!&nbsp; Marie,
Jeannette!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave sprightly orders to his girls, and passed out to be
received with something that resembled long-continued
cheers.&nbsp; All came in ten minutes later, Zwinger leading the
way, and escorting a prosperous man with the figure of an
American desk, who, in acknowledging my bow, gave to himself a
third chin.&nbsp; Zwinger, having placed him at the top of one of
the long tables, bustled around, urging the rest to take their
seats, giving a shout of welcome to late comers, and presently
taking a chair at the lower end of the second long table with
myself on his right, a Mr. Honor&eacute; on his left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much flattered!&rdquo; said Mr. Honor&eacute;,
accepting the introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seated,&rdquo; declared Zwinger of himself, jovially,
&ldquo;seated between two good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red wine stood on the white-clothed tables, and this gave me a
moment of depression, until Zwinger, on soup being cleared,
whispered to me a reassuring word, and I found that, despite
similarity of labels, the contents of the bottles had no
resemblance or likeness to the beverage usually supplied.&nbsp;
Talk up and down the tables was mainly of births, marriages, and
deaths, with, now and again, a description of recent
illness.&nbsp; Also, the state of trade and the condition of
agriculture, and a few references to politics, <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>so guarded
that I knew it could not be a lunch given in the interests of any
political party.&nbsp; I asked a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Zwinger, mysteriously.</p>
<p>I give you my word of honour that he winked.</p>
<p>At the end of the meal&mdash;a good meal, well-cooked, and
served in a way that had nothing of the slap-dash-bang to which
one was accustomed in the dining-room&mdash;Zwinger went around
with cigars, pressing the best and longest upon the acceptance of
the company, detained frequently in the course of his tour by
affectionate greetings, by honest congratulations on the
meal.&nbsp; He spoke in the ear of the Chairman&mdash;a
Sub-Prefect, so Mr. Honor&eacute; assured me, nothing
less&mdash;and scuttled back to his seat just in time to assume
an attitude of listening as the Chairman rose.</p>
<p>We were assembled, said the Chairman, to honour and acclaim
once more the day of September, that was ever in our
hearts.&nbsp; (Very good.)&nbsp; We were assembled to do honour
to those who fought with us on that great day, and fell beside us
for the honour and glory of France.&nbsp; (Very good, very
good.)&nbsp; We were here&mdash;&nbsp; The Chairman called
gesture to the aid of eloquence, swinging his left arm with a
backward movement; guests leaned forward to miss nothing, their
faces becoming flushed as he proceeded, eyes filling as he
recited the names of those who had gone from this world <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>since the
last meeting.&nbsp; His rapidity of utterance increased: the
guests panted as they followed eagerly: one man rose in his
excitement, and neighbours pulled him down.&nbsp; At the door of
the kitchen, the two girls, bearing trays of coffee, waited,
trembling with excitement so that the cups rattled.&nbsp; A
perfect cascade of phrases; glory, country, honour, comrades,
revenge, every word rushing past the others, and then Zwinger
sprang to his feet, echoed the toast wildly, and, holding his
glass, clinked it with mine, clinked it with Mr.
Honor&eacute;&rsquo;s, saluted the company, drank, and sat
down.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The carpenters were early at work the following morning,
joining thus to their duties the functions of an alarum
clock.&nbsp; As I went out for a stroll at eight, intending to go
so far as the fringe of the woods and back, I saw Zwinger walking
up and down outside the restaurant, his hands deep in jacket
pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My felicitations,&rdquo; I said, cheerily, &ldquo;on
the enormous success of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zwinger gave one of his monosyllables that express
disinclination for speech, disinclination to listen to speech
from other people.&nbsp; Turning, he slippered away.</p>

121</span>IX&mdash;THE LEADING LADY</h2>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span><span
class="smcap">To</span> tell the truth, I was not feeling in my
best form.&nbsp; Just before entering the tramcar I had a brief
dispute with my mother in regard to the contents of a fruit-shop
at the beginning of Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road.&nbsp; There are many
subjects on which the two of us fail to see eye to eye, and
frequently a somewhat acrimonious debate ends in triumph on her
side.&nbsp; At times, we get along admirably together; at others
a recommendation from her that I should not exhibit temper goads
me into something like fury.&nbsp; The storm over, I am sorry
that it happened.&nbsp; My mother has often remarked that I can
be a perfect lady when I like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a one to nurse a grievance,&rdquo; she adds.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A couple of minutes and it&rsquo;s all past and
forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our entry into the car was scarcely auspicious, partly because
the question of cherries had not vanished from my thoughts, <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>partly
because I wanted to go up the steps and my mother was resolved to
go inside; the conductor spoke sharply, and my mother resented
his tones.&nbsp; He expressed satisfaction in the knowledge that
all passengers did not closely resemble us, and my mother
retorted that if there were many conductors of his style people
would prefer to walk.&nbsp; He said he supposed that she, being a
woman, would insist on having the final word, and my mother
suggested it must give him a nasty shock to find himself correct
for the first time in his life; she added something about his
features which struck me as being not in quite the best
taste.&nbsp; I tugged at her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be quiet!&rdquo; she said to me sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perfect worry, that&rsquo;s what you are.&nbsp; Catch me
ever letting you come out again to look at the shops!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car started from Holborn on its twopenny journey to
Stamford Hill in these circumstances.&nbsp; The conductor, in
collecting fares, scowled at me, and I frowned back at him;
before going up the steps he looked in again to say ironically
that we were a pretty pair.&nbsp; A young man with his sweetheart
seated next to us thought the remark was addressed to him, and
there ensued a fresh wrangle, at the end of which the youth took
the conductor&rsquo;s number, and half the passengers said the
conductor had not gone <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>outside the bounds of common
civility; the other half referred to him as a
Jack-in-office.&nbsp; The young woman spoke to me and made some
complimentary allusion to my looks and general appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still!&rdquo; ordered my mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t have you talking to Tom, Dick, and Harry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that argument was useless; it would have been a waste
of time to point out that these names could not be rightly
applied to my new friend.&nbsp; She, an amiable person, showed me
the Holborn Town Hall, and remarked that she sometimes went to
concerts there; the reference must have suggested something to
me, for, despite my mother&rsquo;s efforts to restrain, I lifted
up my voice and sang.&nbsp; It was but a simple melody, but the
earnestness I put into it seemed to touch the hearts of other
passengers, and when I finished they had ceased the dispute
regarding the conductor and were nodding to me pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less noise inside there!&rdquo; commanded the
conductor, returned from upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her sing if she wants to,&rdquo; said a matronly
woman near the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a-going to have this tramcar turned into
a Queen&rsquo;s Hall,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and you ought to
know yourself better than encourage her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was young myself once.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t yesterday,&rdquo; he
suggested.</p>
<p>The song had received so much favour that I considered the
wisdom of giving them either another or diversifying the
entertainment by offering some of my celebrated imitations.&nbsp;
These have always been highly successful at home and at the
houses of relatives; an uncle of mine remarked on one occasion
that they were far and away superior to the originals.&nbsp; I
had not, however, previously attempted them before an audience of
strangers, and this, for the moment, made me shy and
nervous.&nbsp; The moment of hesitation over, I started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s what I call clever,&rdquo; said the
young man near to us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Milly, if you could only do
something like that I might get reelly fond of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My first idea was to make eyes at him; reflection told me that
the love of a man who was so easily influenced could never be
worth having, and I reassured the girl with a smile.&nbsp;
Glancing up and down the car, I could see that I had now secured
complete attention.&nbsp; Men had folded up evening newspapers,
and were waiting to see what I would do next; women beamed in my
direction and one opposite offered me chocolates.&nbsp; I took
the box, but my mother, whose knowledge of the rules of etiquette
forms the subject of one of her proudest boasts, said it would be
more genteel to select only one of the sweets.&nbsp; I accepted
the hint, and my mother&mdash;now in <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>good temper, and making no attempt
to conceal the fact&mdash;remarked to the others that I had
always been noted for excellence of behaviour.</p>
<p>I gave next a recitation&mdash;one of my own
composition&mdash;a short but telling piece, with somewhat
humorous references to the incident of a cat who found its saucer
of milk empty.&nbsp; This went only fairly well; I think I must
give more care to voice-production.&nbsp; The matronly lady near
the door asked what it was supposed to be all about, and my
mother readily furnished a sort of synopsis.&nbsp; Some one
begged I would sing again, but, discouraged by the cool
acceptance of the recital, I declined, until my mother begged and
entreated me not to sing.&nbsp; At the conclusion there was that
genuine and hearty applause which every public performer
recognises and welcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; cried some of the passengers,
&ldquo;Shoreditch Church, already!&rdquo;&nbsp; They said goodbye
to me, and I endeavoured to thank them for their kindness in
listening to my poor efforts.&nbsp; One offered me a coin, which
I flung upon the floor.&nbsp; I am an amateur, not a
professional.</p>
<p>It was as the car went up Stoke Newington Road that I
introduced my most diverting item.&nbsp; It has always pleased,
but I was not certain that here it would be appreciated.&nbsp;
The idea is to begin with a smile, to allow the <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>smile to
broaden and become more pronounced; this is followed by a
chuckle, and then comes a peal of laughter.&nbsp; My mother
identified the early stages, and, trembling with pride, warned
the rest to pay special and particular notice.&nbsp; I am not
exaggerating when I say that in less than a minute I had the
whole car with me&mdash;every one amused, some roaring.&nbsp; The
conductor put his hand over his face, but was compelled to give
way, and he went so far as to admit, very handsomely, that it was
the funniest thing he had witnessed outside the Dalston
Hippodrome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tire yourself, darling,&rdquo; begged my
mother solicitously, and speaking in aristocratic tones.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be careful not to overdo it.&nbsp; You know what
you&rsquo;re like when you&rsquo;ve been excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pushed her advice aside, and when the car slowed up near the
station I do believe all who were going on to the terminus felt
honestly sorry to see me preparing to leave.&nbsp; As we stood on
the pavement&mdash;the conductor had given us a hand, and he
apologised for brusqueness of behaviour at the start, explaining
that there had been an awkward passenger on the previous journey,
and they had come to words&mdash;as we stood, I say, on the
pavement, every one in the car waved hands, and the young man, I
was gratified to notice, blew a kiss.</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>&ldquo;Hullo, Ernest!&rdquo; said my mother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here we are at last.&nbsp; Been waiting long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Months and months and months,&rdquo; replied my
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;What sort of a girl has she been?&nbsp;
Baby,&rdquo; he went on, addressing me, and taking me in his
arms, &ldquo;you may be as clever as your mother tries to make
out, but I take me oath you don&rsquo;t get none the lighter as
time goes on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you expect?&rdquo; demanded the official,
turning upon him suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you look for at a
time like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son!&rdquo; replied the other, with pride.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Me and his mother have give him six months at a
boarding-school in Kent, and he&rsquo;s coming home this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean what you mean.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Inspector became more calm as he essayed the task known to
railway men as knocking sense into the heads of the public.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What I intended to say was that at this time of the year,
and with all these specials about, it&rsquo;s only reasonable to
assume that the ordinary trains&mdash;&nbsp; See what I&rsquo;m
driving at, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Steam&rsquo;s a wonderful
invention, but we can&rsquo;t do impossibilities.&nbsp; Think of
the old coaching-days; what must it have been like
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&ldquo;His mother&rsquo;s waiting at home, else I
shouldn&rsquo;t be so eager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Inspector, with a touch of either
sentiment or condescension.&nbsp; &ldquo;We all know what women
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Chelsfield, walking along the platform with the Inspector
for the sake of company and the encouragement of warmth, had to
admit that he felt equally anxious, and offered the present of a
cigar which he described as harmless; the official accepted it
graciously, and promised to make it the subject of an experiment
on the following Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; In return he gave the
latest news from Chislehurst, and guaranteed to eat his silk hat
if the Emperor recovered.&nbsp; He felt sorry for Napoleon, and
expressed the view that it was a pity there was only one son in
the family.&nbsp; Nice enough young fellow, it was true; he had
shaken hands with the Inspector once, but if anything happened to
the Prince Imperial, where would they be?&nbsp; The
Inspector&rsquo;s estimate of the right number in a family
coincided with the number in his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Mr. Chelsfield, with a nod in the
direction of the down line&mdash;&ldquo;this is the only one
we&rsquo;ve got.&nbsp; Only one we ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care not to spoil him.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s always
the risk when there&rsquo;s only one.&nbsp; Now my
six&mdash;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the train signalled.&nbsp; Get <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>to the
other end of the platform, and then you can&rsquo;t miss
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The platform was long under its wooden roof, and Mr.
Chelsfield could not move with the celerity he had shown in the
early &rsquo;sixties; some of his colleagues at the warehouse
said it was rheumatism, but he declared it to be only a slight
stiffness of the joints.&nbsp; Passengers were going through the
barrier, and, flushed by anxiety, he looked about; presently made
a dash through the crowd, seized a lad who wore a mortar-board,
and pinched his ear affectionately.&nbsp; On the lad turning and
demanding an explanation, Mr. Chelsfield apologised for his
error, and hurried off to continue his search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hours and a half,&rdquo; said the friendly
Inspector later.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is before the
next.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t worth while waiting if you only live
up in Holborn.&nbsp; Hop into a &rsquo;bus outside the
station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; Mr. Chelsfield admitted
concernedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to go back and tell his
mother.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be out of her mind else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just my argument,&rdquo; claimed the Inspector.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;d got six, like I have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Chelsfield stepped out of the omnibus at Chancery Lane,
and, paying the conductor, went along to Bedford Row with some
wisps of the straw belonging to the conveyance attached to his
boots.&nbsp; He felt <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>himself to be on the edge of a
painful scene, and wondered where he should find the sal volatile
if it happened to be wanted.&nbsp; The front door of the offices,
with its elaborate knocker, was open, and he went slowly
downstairs to the living-rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said his wife.&nbsp; He shook his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak up!&rdquo; she commanded; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t hear when you turn your face to the wall and mumble
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave the explanation and waited for signs of collapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty one to send to a railway-station,
and no mistake!&rdquo; she remarked, taking off the
tea-cosy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Another time I must go myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None for me, mother,&rdquo; he said desolately.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t drink it even if you poured it out.&nbsp;
Wonder what&rsquo;s happened to the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked up and down the room, looked through the window at
the iron grating, and rubbed his head furiously with a red
pocket-handkerchief, the wife watching him with an amused
expression.&nbsp; As she took the knife in order to cut the
home-made cake, still warm from the oven, he raised his hand as a
feeble protest against asking him to taste food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we have the winder open?&rdquo; he asked
submissively.&nbsp; &ldquo;This room seems stuffy to <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>me, or else
it is that I&rsquo;m upset.&nbsp; I feel&mdash;I feel as though I
can&rsquo;t sit down at this table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said his wife, with a
wink&mdash;&ldquo;suppose you have a look underneath
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy crawled out, smoothed his hair, and submitted a
forehead to his parent; the mother came near to choking with
delight at the success of her elaborate scheme, and presently
leaned head exhaustedly against the antimacassar which protected
the back of the horsehair easy-chair.&nbsp; How on earth had they
missed each other?&mdash;that was what the delighted father
wanted to know.&nbsp; Henry must have jumped out of the train and
cut away uncommonly sharp.&nbsp; Henry, permitted under the
special circumstances to discard convention and begin with cake,
working back through the toast to the bread and butter, confessed
that he had lost no time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my lad,&rdquo; urged his father more seriously,
&ldquo;you knowed that I was coming to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had another fellow with me,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;arresting a doubled piece of bread and
butter on its way from the plate&mdash;&ldquo;and didn&rsquo;t
you want him to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, father!&rdquo; interposed the
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Henry, my child, ask if you want a second
piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t exactly that,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, perhaps, you&rsquo;ll kindly tell me what <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>was the
reason.&nbsp; Come on, now; out with it!&nbsp; I want an
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought perhaps you might kiss me, father.&nbsp; And
Watherston standing by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very natural on the boy&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; declared
the mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;You forget that Henry&rsquo;s growing
up.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t mind it in private, but there comes a
time when a boy doesn&rsquo;t want all this fuss in
public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that was the only reason&mdash;&rdquo; said the
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk with your mouth full!&rdquo; ordered
his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;You never see Henry do it.&nbsp; And one
arm off the table, if you please.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her husband
obeyed, taking up an attitude of greater precision and obvious
discomfort.&nbsp; &ldquo;That sounds like Gleeson &amp; Co. going
out; I shall have to see about my pail and flannel, and get up
there and do their floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo; began the boy sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We decided otherwise, my dear,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t settle it in a hurry by any means; your
father and me talked it over night after night, and eventually we
came to a definite conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, my lad&rdquo;&mdash;the father took up the
explanation&mdash;&ldquo;there was money going out for your
schooling, and provisions don&rsquo;t get no cheaper, and we was
both anxious not to touch the little nest-egg we&rsquo;ve put
by.&nbsp; Besides&rdquo;&mdash;with spirit, on noting the crimson
look of annoyance on his son&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;besides,
it&rsquo;s <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>purely a matter for us to settle.&nbsp; If your mother
doesn&rsquo;t mind going on with the housekeeper work, and if I
don&rsquo;t object to her doing it, why, there&rsquo;s nothing
more to be said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tea-table endured a silence of nearly a minute.&nbsp; The
two parents examined the pattern of the oilcloth that covered
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the boy, with the new manner
acquired at the boarding-school, &ldquo;but am I to understand
that my feelings are not to be considered in the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother put out her hand quickly and patted her
husband&rsquo;s arm, upraised to give a gesture that would
emphasise his reply.&nbsp; He dropped it, and took a long, loud
drink from a saucer that trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can talk about this,&rdquo; she said hurriedly,
&ldquo;another time.&nbsp; We shall have a clear fortnight,
Henry, before you start work.&nbsp; Say grace!&rdquo;&nbsp; They
bowed their heads, and joined in the Amen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you
make some nice new friends at the boarding-school, my dear?&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve arranged all about your party for the fifteenth, and
I think, by a little scrounging and a hand-round supper, we ought
to be able to manage twelve.&nbsp; Including us three, that
is.&nbsp; If we go over that, there&rsquo;s always the risk of
having the unlucky number, and that spoils everybody&rsquo;s
pleasure.&nbsp; Come along with me, and we can have a good talk
over the arrangements whilst I&rsquo;m tying on my apern.&nbsp;
What <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>I
was wondering was whether we should have all boys, old friends of
yours about the neighbourhood, or whether to invite a few
girls.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s your friend Jessie,&rdquo; she bustled
on waggishly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t let her feel
neglected.&nbsp; Always asks after you, Jessie does.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She lowered her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s got the
idea into his head that the boarding-school may have induced you
to be high and mighty, and make you look down on them and
us.&nbsp; But of course, my dear, I know better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was leaning against the stout oak door later, as his
mother cleaned and hearthstoned the steps; two minutes, she
remarked, and her work would be over.&nbsp; In reply to his
urgent appeal, she gave a promise that so soon as he began to
earn money the work should be finished for good.&nbsp; A lad in a
mortar-board came through from the direction of Holborn, and
strolled up on the other side, examining the numbers.&nbsp;
Attracted by the sound of voices, he crossed over and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, my good woman,&rdquo; he said, with cheerful
condescension, to the kneeling figure, &ldquo;Number thirty-five,
I want.&nbsp; These figures are so confoundedly indistinct.&nbsp;
Name, Chelsfield&mdash;Henry Chelsfield.&nbsp; Can you tell me
where I shall find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t fur to go,&rdquo; she remarked, and
beckoned with her handful of flannel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must
apologise for being caught in my <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>disables,&rdquo; she went on,
levering herself up with the aid of the pail.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t hear the last of this for a long time.&nbsp;
Still, as I say, we&rsquo;ve all got to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her son came forward, and, waiting for the introduction, she
smoothed her grey hair with the back of a wet hand.&nbsp; The
boy&rsquo;s father came out, too, wearing a tasselled smoking-cap
rakishly; to honour the occasion he had lighted the fellow to the
cigar given away to the friendly Inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Chelsfield!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy glanced at his mother, looked over a shoulder at his
father.&nbsp; He hesitated for a moment, then cleared the damp
steps at a single jump, and taking his friend&rsquo;s arm, led
him across the roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Called round, Chelsfield,&rdquo; the mortar-board lad
said, &ldquo;called round at once to tell you that I find
I&rsquo;m engaged two deep for the evening you&rsquo;ve fixed for
Drury Lane.&nbsp; Now, what I want to suggest is this.&nbsp; How
about you changing your date?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father and mother stood just outside the doorway, speaking
no word, but listening and waiting.&nbsp; The visitor made a
movement to re-cross, but Henry detained him.&nbsp; The mother
coughed in order to give a reminder of her presence.&nbsp; The
visitor, breaking off in the discussion, recommended that Henry
should fetch a cap and stroll with him as far as Gray&rsquo;s Inn
Road and see him into a <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Favorite omnibus for the return to
Islington.&nbsp; Henry ran in, with a mumbled explanation to his
parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite an old-fashioned bit of London here,&rdquo;
remarked the polite boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Chelsfield, coming forward
eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes, sir.&nbsp; People often notice
that.&nbsp; Years ago, I b&rsquo;lieve, quite aristocrats used to
live here.&nbsp; London&rsquo;s changing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Improving,&rdquo; suggested the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon the next thirty years will show a lot of
difference.&nbsp; Me and the wife,&rdquo; he continued, with a
jerk of the head towards her, &ldquo;me and her, we recollect
&rsquo;Olborn, of course, long before the Viaduct was
opened.&nbsp; Previous to that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their boy came out between them with a rush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready, Chelsfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite ready, Watherston,&rdquo; he replied, nervously
and briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to have missed seeing your people,&rdquo;
remarked the polite lad, as they went off arm-in-arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps some other time I may have the
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The space of time mentioned by old Chelsfield elapsed, but he
prevented himself from enjoying the content of a successful
prophet by commencing rather absurdly to break up <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>in health
almost immediately after venturing upon the tolerably safe
anticipation.&nbsp; Amongst the changes of thirty years was the
fact that Chelsfield, as a name, had become better known; even
the folk who flew through the main streets of London on motor
omnibuses, and had to give nearly all their attention to the
holding on of hats, could not evade recognition of the hoardings;
the Chelsfield posters declined to be ignored.&nbsp; If you
closed your eyes to these, you were nearly sure to encounter the
name in your daily paper.&nbsp; If you missed it in your daily
paper, it came into the letter-box, marked &ldquo;Very
Important.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you dodged it there, it confronted you
on your theatre programme at night.&nbsp; Leaving the theatre and
endeavouring to forget the name, you saw it at a popular corner,
being written with great deliberation in illuminated letters, as
though some invisible giant had made up his mind to grasp the
rudiments of education.</p>
<p>Henry Chelsfield himself was not insensible to the determined
appeals, and, going home in his electric brougham, he counted
them.&nbsp; Thus one evening he found a dreary gap between the
Cobden statue and the Britannia, and immediately made memorandum
of the circumstance in his note-book, in order that the
deplorable omission might be attended to on the following
day.&nbsp; All very well for the advertising agents to send him a
box for the <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>theatre, but these people had to be kept up to the
mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can be amiable enough,&rdquo; he said to the clock
inside the brougham, &ldquo;in private affairs, but I&rsquo;m
very different where money matters are concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chelsfield might be flattering himself, or he might be telling
the truth; anyhow he was a Londoner, with a Londoner&rsquo;s
weakness for orders for the play.&nbsp; That was why he had left
his offices early; that was why he proposed to eat at an unusual
hour; that was why, on arriving at Hampstead, he ordered the man
to bring the brougham round again at half-past seven.&nbsp; He
dined alone, with a portrait of a good-looking woman, painted by
Herkomer, facing him; at her side a lad, with small eyes rather
close to each other.&nbsp; Chelsfield lifted his glass when the
two maids had left the room and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jessie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not drink a toast to the boy.</p>
<p>Watherston, from a house nearer the Heath, came in as
Chelsfield pretended to smoke a cigarette&mdash;he had been
thinking that one man in a private box would present a lonely
figure to the audience; the gallery would say that he had no
friends&mdash;and Watherston asked to be excused for once from
joining in a game of billiards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could have happened better!&rdquo; cried
Chelsfield, arousing himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;You <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>have only
to run home and jump into evening dress, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy wants me to take him to see the conjuring people
at St. George&rsquo;s Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not spoiling that lad of yours, I hope,
Watherston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not spoiling my lad,&rdquo; retorted
Watherston, speaking with emphasis.&nbsp; The two men gazed at
each other with the sudden acerbity of manner that comes at times
to the closest friends.&nbsp; Chelsfield&rsquo;s eyes went
presently to the fruit on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ever hear
anything of yours?&rdquo; demanded Watherston, following up his
advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt whatever,&rdquo; replied
Chelsfield testily, &ldquo;that he disappeared in South
Africa.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to discuss the matter
again.&nbsp; He was older than your boy.&nbsp; And you know as
well as I do that after his mother died he went to the
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told him to stay there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give you and your lad a lift as far as
Kingsway,&rdquo; said Chelsfield, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s of any
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be much help to us,&rdquo; replied his
friend candidly; &ldquo;but we shall be company for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Watherston boy was enthusiastic about the swift ride,
enthusiastic about the performance he was about to see,
enthusiastic at being with his father, enthusiastic over
everything.&nbsp; Chelsfield, watching him on the <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>way,
thought that no man desired any better company than that of a
cheerful son.&nbsp; Arrived at Holborn, he suddenly announced
that he had decided to take the complimentary step of giving up
the theatre-box and of joining them in their visit to St.
George&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; As he lowered the window and put his
head out to speak to his man, the boy and father conferred in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chelsfield!&rdquo; said the friend, touching his
sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get out.&nbsp; I want to speak to you
privately.&nbsp; Fact is&rdquo;&mdash;on the
pavement&mdash;&ldquo;fact is&mdash;you know what boys are, and
I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t mind&mdash;but he tells me that he
would rather go with me alone; and, to tell you the truth, I
don&rsquo;t want to share him this evening.&nbsp; You see, he
goes back to Rugby to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chelsfield dismissed his brougham and decided to walk the
remainder of the way.&nbsp; He went with head down, and so deep
in thought that it startled him when, in a turning from the new
highway, he was accosted by one of a long file of men, waiting to
march into the shelter for the night.&nbsp; There were about a
hundred of them&mdash;old, young, middle-aged, all imperfectly
shod, hands in pockets.&nbsp; He glanced along the line before
replying.&nbsp; The light from a lamp showed the face of one, the
youngest of all.</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said the man who had
spoken to him, in an amiable tone of voice, &ldquo;if you
&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t got any tobacker, you can&rsquo;t give us
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go and get some,&rdquo; he
remarked with agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good iron!&rdquo; said the man approvingly.</p>
<p>Chelsfield returned from the Strand breathless, a parcel under
his arm, and, removing the string with trembling fingers, began
the work of distribution.&nbsp; Some of the men received the
ounce gratefully, some mentioned that it was all done for the
sake of advertisement, some demanded why he had not also brought
pipes, some accepted with a snatch.&nbsp; Chelsfield had not
regained full control of his breathing powers when he reached the
lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you are not a smoker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a smoker; but I don&rsquo;t accept anything from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chelsfield took his son&rsquo;s hand and tried to pull him
from his place.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to speak to you, dear
boy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve something important to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said something important to me once,&rdquo;
retorted the other doggedly, &ldquo;and you don&rsquo;t have a
chance of saying anything important to me again.&nbsp; Be off,
before I set the others on to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; His attitude
expressed determination.</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Chelsfield&rsquo;s housekeeper, at breakfast the next
morning, asked in her respectful manner what he thought of the
comedy he had seen the previous night.&nbsp; Chelsfield told her
that he considered it extremely far-fetched.</p>
<h2><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>XI&mdash;SCOTTER&rsquo;S LUCK</h2>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span><span
class="smcap">His</span> opponent, after a good look at the
table, adjusted his cue, and, disregarding the murmur of
&ldquo;Whitechapel!&rdquo; sent spot white into a pocket.&nbsp;
Many of the spectators volunteered advice, the while Scotter
stood back and glanced self-commiseratingly at the
scoring-board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all I am, marker?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your total figure, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scatter&rsquo;s opponent took time in aiming at the red, and
the suggestion that he had gone to sleep did not induce him to
hurry.&nbsp; Striking his own ball gently and rather high up, the
two travelled slowly into baulk.&nbsp; Scotter remarked dismally
that this was just his luck, and found spot white; he was about
to make a wild shot up and down the table when he changed his
mind, and, considering angles, drew back his cue and prepared to
send his ball at a particular point of the cushion.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>&ldquo;This ought to do it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
whether it will or not is more than I can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bell rang.&nbsp; On the instant the men were out of the
billiard-room; Scotter the last, because his first neat and
orderly idea was to replace his cue in the stand, the second, a
time-saving notion, was to leave it resting against the table,
and in this confusion of thought a few moments were wasted.&nbsp;
As the two horses plunged and reared in the yard, and made a dash
through the short avenue of people outside the gates, one or two
of his helmeted colleagues expressed the opinion that when the
last trump sounded Scotter would be the last to respond, bringing
with him an assortment of about ten good and sufficient
excuses.&nbsp; Above the clanging and the noise, he was asked
whether he had ever been really in time for anything but his
meals; he blushed when they declared that girls were probably
waiting for him at altars in various churches of London, growing
old and cross and tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we bound for?&rdquo; he asked, to change the
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to a fire, Scotty, my lad,&rdquo; it
was explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know?&nbsp; You
thought we were off to an evening party, to have a game of
postman&rsquo;s knock.&nbsp; But no; we&rsquo;re going to a fire,
and we&rsquo;ve got to put it out soon as we possibly can.&nbsp;
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>Remember
that, won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Not to make it burn brighter, but to
put it out.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s done with the aid of a syphon of
soda.&nbsp; You take the syphon like this, and you remark to the
fire, &lsquo;Say when!&rsquo; and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Southampton Row, at the narrow part, blocked with confused
traffic; the wild horses had to pretend to be tamed whilst a
passage was made.&nbsp; Fire-engines were also coming along Hart
Street and from Kingsway; tramcars bobbing up from the tunnel
waited politely.&nbsp; The engine managed to reach the street,
and a stout superintendent, glancing at his watch, told the men
they stood an excellent chance of winning the booby prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that pretty compliment,&rdquo; they said, dropping
from the engine, &ldquo;we have to thank you, Mister Sleepy
Scotter, Esquire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Police keeping the people back; the street already a river,
streams of water being sent high up at two houses,
neighbours&rsquo; faces out with the nearest wearing an
expression of anxiety, whilst those a few doors off and opposite
showed nothing more than interest.&nbsp; Furniture hurled out of
windows, with now and again a smash.&nbsp; The firemen went about
their work alertly and swiftly; when an order was given half a
dozen hurried to obey.&nbsp; More engines arriving and two
ladders.&nbsp; On the second floor of one of the houses a burst
of flame that cracked the windows.</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>&ldquo;Is everybody out?&rdquo; demanded an
official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All out, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mather was called.&nbsp; Mrs. Mather, found in tears on
the kerb, with children around her, was asked sharply whether
these represented her entire family; replied that if they did but
stand still she would count them.&nbsp; One, two, three, four,
five; yes, sir; we&rsquo;re all here.&nbsp; Mather himself away
on a job at Silvertown.&nbsp; All the dear, blessed youngsters
safe, thanks be; might have been a good deal worse.&nbsp; Mrs.
Mather had never been in a fire before, but an aunt of hers
living up at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells way once had the misfortune to
overturn a lamp&mdash;What was that?&nbsp; Six?&nbsp; No, no; the
neighbour must be confusing her with another lady.&nbsp; Bless
Mrs. Mather&rsquo;s soul; a parent ought surely to be allowed to
know how many children she possessed.&nbsp; There was Tommy, the
eldest, next Ethel, next Walter, next Gracie, and then Hubert,
then Mrs. Mather, with a gesture of self-reproof, begged to
apologise.&nbsp; The neighbour was correct.&nbsp; Mrs. Mather
admitted she had overlooked the baby, and, whilst she thought of
it, there was the little girl from Forty-eight who came in to
mind the kid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a light weight, Scotter,&rdquo; said the
Superintendent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Up you go, and do your very
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>Scotter went up the escape, bending his head to dodge
flames that were darting out from the second floor; up again, and
disappeared.&nbsp; There was a crash there of something falling
in; the helmeted men below gave a low whistle.&nbsp; That settled
poor Scotter&rsquo;s game of billiards.&nbsp; That relieved him
of any difficulty of knowing what to do with plain white and the
red left in baulk.&nbsp; That meant a rare old scene later on,
with Scotty&rsquo;s sweetheart coming round to the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another man up!&rdquo; ordered the Superintendent.</p>
<p>The second was half-way up, and had been drenched by error,
when Scotter reappeared at the top window.&nbsp; He had the baby
in a shawl that was tied at his neck; in the left arm he carried
a limp little girl; the crowd in the street roared
&ldquo;Hip-pip&mdash;hooray!&rdquo; and Mrs. Mather cried
warningly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay up there; come
down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes your little lot complete, then,&rdquo;
remarked the Superintendent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all here now,&rdquo; conceded the
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;How I come to overlook the fact that there was
one short is more than I can tell you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
it&rsquo;s very kind of this gentleman.&nbsp; When baby&rsquo;s
old enough he must thank him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all right, Scotter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you, sir.&nbsp; Bit singed, but nothing to
brag about.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>The
crowd lost all its good spirits so soon as the first engine was
sent home, and folk told each other regretfully that there were
no fires now as in the old days.&nbsp; The waiting horses had
recovered breath and began to caper about to impress the crowd
with a sense of their importance.&nbsp; People to whom news had
come tardily ran up from Clerkenwell Road demanding to know the
whereabouts of the fire, and, being told it was out, censured the
County Council, their informants, and themselves.&nbsp; Two
firemen were selected to remain in charge; the others, dusting
knees and rubbing knuckles into eyes, waited for orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get off back, you lot.&nbsp; Scotter, you did
uncommonly well.&nbsp; Just given your name to some newspaper
men.&nbsp; Married man?&nbsp; Not yet?&nbsp; I was going to say,
if you were, your missus would be proud of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pace was good on the return journey, but not frantic, and
Scotter was told by a dozen experts what to do to the burn on his
left wrist.&nbsp; At the station they assisted him in the task of
washing, and made a neat bandage; over cups of tea they went
through the details of the fire, and extinguished it again.&nbsp;
A move was made to the billiard-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spot white&rsquo;s turn,&rdquo; announced one, taking
up position at the marking-board.&nbsp; &ldquo;Plain white and
the red both in baulk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Glancing <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>at the
pegs, &ldquo;Twenty-three plays forty-eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to buck up, Scotter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took careful aim.&nbsp; Sent his ball against the
right-hand cushion; it went from this to the top of the table,
across to the left, travelled down, and dropped gently into the
right-hand lower pocket.&nbsp; Three deducted from his score.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with
me,&rdquo; said Scotter despairingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Somehow or
other, I can&rsquo;t do anything right to-day.&rdquo;</p>

159</span>XII&mdash;MEANS OF TRANSPORT</h2>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> indignation meeting occurred without any
of the printed entreaties usually found needful in order to
induce the public to arouse.&nbsp; It seems less strange that
only ladies attended, for the sex is notoriously beginning to
take an interest in public questions.</p>
<p>Mr. Woods, driving one of his own wagonettes, was talking to
the two passengers secured at the railway station four miles off
and giving them a short autobiography&mdash;&ldquo;Begun to work,
I did, afore I were twelve, I did!&rdquo;&mdash;when he caught
sight of the gathering and broke off to express amazement; he
gave at once an emphatic but scarcely original declaration that
if women secured the vote they would not know what to do with
it.&nbsp; The passengers differed from this view, and Mr. Woods,
anxious to secure their patronage for the return journey,
hastened to admit that he had not had the time to study the
question thoroughly.&nbsp; A <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>lady detached herself from the group
and, holding her tweed cap on her head, ran across.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s amiss, Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a missis,&rdquo; she added, robbed of breath
by indignation and hurry.&nbsp; &ldquo;That Mrs. Jarrett, as she
calls herself.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been and opened some Tea
Gardens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;News to me,&rdquo; he remarked alarmedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;News to all of us.&nbsp; She ain&rsquo;t been here more
than three months, and this morning there&rsquo;s playcards all
over her place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought she seemed a nicely spoken person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait,&rdquo; said Jane threateningly, &ldquo;until
we begin to talk to her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll get what I call some
home truths if she don&rsquo;t look out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passengers suggested mildly that their time was limited,
and Woods, rendered silent by the extraordinary nature of the
information, drove on to the edge of the forest, contenting
himself by indicating on the way the cottage where his
sister-in-law Jane resided.&nbsp; In the clouded diamond panes it
exhibited shyly, as did most of the other cottages, a small card
that whispered the word &ldquo;Teas&rdquo;; a few bottles of
ginger-beer rested on the sill to suggest that the establishment
had further resources.&nbsp; After the passengers alighted he
drove around by the road that skirted the wood, checking <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>the horse
slightly on approaching the house and lawn occupied by the
new-comer.&nbsp; Tables had been placed, with striped cloths held
by shining clips; a small marquee was being fixed in the
corner.&nbsp; The neatly-painted board at the gate gave the
title, &ldquo;Forest Tea Gardens,&rdquo; adding sentences to the
effect that refreshments of the best quality could be obtained at
any hour&mdash;&ldquo;Large Parties and Small Parties catered
for; proprietress, Clara Jarrett.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Mr. Woods,
unwilling to display curiosity, allowed his horse to go on, an
automatic pianoforte started, with great vivacity, a waltz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great thing is,&rdquo; announced Mr. Woods, speaking
from his conveyance to the meeting as though he were a candidate
for Parliament&mdash;&ldquo;is not to lose your heads.&nbsp; Keep
perfectly calm and cool, and everything&rsquo;ll come right in
the long run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Question is, how long a run is it going to be?&rdquo;
demanded one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;provided that we
all stick together, she can&rsquo;t last half-way through the
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; interrupted Woods irritably,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to make the best of it.&nbsp;
Competition&rsquo;s bound to exist in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like it, Mr. Woods, if
somebody&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One matter at a time.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s keep to <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>the
question.&nbsp; What I want you to recognise is that you&rsquo;ve
got a true friend in me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no partic&rsquo;lar
objection to her; as I said just now to my sister-in-law, she
always seemed a nicely spoken person, and I don&rsquo;t wish to
do her any harm whatsoever.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no doubt at
all in my mind that so far as we are concerned she&rsquo;s a
interloper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women appeared to find the description too lenient.&nbsp;
One announced vehemently that, before Mr. Woods came along, they
had almost decided to go in a body and pull down the signboard,
demolish the marquee, and in other ways convey the fact that they
looked upon the new Tea Gardens with disapproval.&nbsp; Goodness
knew, there had never been much profit made out of sixpenny teas;
it seemed likely that in the future it would be scarcely worth
while to make cakes and keep the kettle boiling.&nbsp; Woods,
again begging for moderation, urged they should cease talking for
the space of two seconds and listen to him.&nbsp; He, with his
cabs and wagonettes, had full control over all the traffic from
the station, excepting that small part which took the (as he
thought) mistaken course of deciding to walk.&nbsp; Nearly all of
these passengers put one inquiry to him or to his men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do keep quiet until I&rsquo;ve finished,&rdquo;
prayed Woods.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only got half a dozen more words to
say, and I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>He,
on his side, was prepared to guarantee that the new Tea Gardens
should never, by speech or hint, be recommended.&nbsp; If any
passenger, having heard of them, mentioned the name, then Mr.
Woods or his men could be relied upon to cast discredit
ingeniously without bringing themselves within the domain of the
laws of libel.&nbsp; On their side, they must be prepared for
some special efforts; must make a greater show; endeavour to
engage the passing visitor by welcome smiles; take care to keep
windows open.&nbsp; He feared they did not always realise the
Londoner&rsquo;s partiality for fresh air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; asked his sister-in-law defiantly,
&ldquo;are we supposed to keep on friendly terms with her whilst
all this is going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please yourselves,&rdquo; replied Mr. Woods
generously.&nbsp; &ldquo;So far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I shall
continue to pass the time of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And go on bringing her illustrated newspapers, I
suppose, from the station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll allow me, Jane, to be the best judge of my
own affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re setting out to be the best judge of
ours as well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you good advice,&rdquo; said Mr.
Woods, gathering the reins, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s beyond human
power to compel you to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Confidence in himself was shaken by information conveyed by
the two passengers on the return journey.&nbsp; Having forgotten
the <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>exact whereabouts of his sister-in-law&rsquo;s house
they had gone into the new Tea Gardens, and their content and
satisfaction with the treatment received made subject of
conversation throughout the journey.&nbsp; The excellence of the
watercress, the surprising freshness of the eggs, the admirable
quality of the home-made jam&mdash;all these impressed them
favourably, and they talked of arranging with friends a picnic on
a large scale and without the inconvenience of heavy
baskets.&nbsp; Mr. Woods, not being asked for an opinion, gave
several; one was in favour of splitting the party up amongst the
cottages.&nbsp; He declared this plan would encourage sociability
and give an insight into country life.&nbsp; For almost the first
time in his professional career Woods found himself told to mind
his own business.&nbsp; He invented some compensation by speaking
sharply to one of his men whom he charged with the offence of
keeping hands in pockets.</p>
<p>The members of the home syndicate received such a quick
succession of blows from the new Tea Gardens that they began to
experience a kind of dazed resignation, and it became the duty of
Mr. Woods to order them to awake.&nbsp; The automatic pianoforte
was followed by engagement from town of two young nieces, who
were not content with demure costume and long blue pinafore, but
must needs, if you please, wear a rather <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>attractive
lace cap.&nbsp; After this came a large rocking-horse for the
pleasure of children, or, failing children, the content of
grown-ups who fancied equestrian exercise and wished to promote
digestion.&nbsp; After this, a giant&rsquo;s stride.&nbsp; After
this, a skittle-alley which drew away of an evening many of the
best and most regular customers from &ldquo;The Running
Stag.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this, a lawn-tennis court, with rackets
and balls provided without charge to those who had taken the
shilling tea.&nbsp; It was in regard to the shilling tea that
Woods&rsquo;s sister-in-law, ignoring him, went direct to the
vicar, from whom she received the disappointing information that
the words &ldquo;ad lib.&rdquo; were not, in themselves,
offensive, or calculated to undermine the morality of the
village; he added some trenchant remarks concerning the duties of
parents, which Jane assumed to refer to other ladies.&nbsp; Jane
assured the vicar that she did all that was possible in the
distribution of good counsel, and he remarked that it would make
a useful change for her to vary the method by accepting it.&nbsp;
So far as Mrs. Jarrett and Sundays were concerned, she and her
nieces came to church in the mornings; they worked hard in the
afternoon, and they rested in the evening.&nbsp; The vicar,
admitting that he might be considered either very old-fashioned
or very new-fashioned, declared this a good manner of spending
the day, and gave a short account <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>of Sundays in the early part of the
seventeenth century.&nbsp; Woods, to whom this was reported,
said, guardedly, that the events referred to occurred before he
came to town.</p>
<p>The fly-master had, at this period, troubles of his own which
decreased his interest in regard to the rivalry in the tea
trade.&nbsp; The first news came from one of the nieces back from
a visit to town on an occasion when Woods, at the foot of the
hill, stepped down to walk and encourage his horse.&nbsp; The
detached position which he had assumed since the beginning of the
dispute had been modified because Jane&rsquo;s daughter told one
of his young men (and the young man told Mr. Woods) that Jane had
announced an opinion to the effect that her brother-in-law found
the money to finance the Tea Gardens, a suggestion so unfair and
so preposterous that he declared his intention of allowing them
to fight their battles without further assistance from him;
henceforth, he proposed to take up a strictly impartial
attitude.&nbsp; Consequently, he had recommenced the bringing of
illustrated newspapers, and more than once he and Mrs. Jarrett
discussed impending marriages in high life, conduct of the German
Emperor, accidents caused by motor-cars, and other topical
subjects.&nbsp; The niece, taking charge of the roll of journals,
had distributed amongst the passengers some of Mrs.
Jarrett&rsquo;s neatly printed cards, had pointed out to them <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>a notable
church and conspicuous dwellings.&nbsp; Leaning over the side of
the conveyance, she gave the information already referred to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Londoners will have your lark,&rdquo; he
commented.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your aunt&rsquo;s just the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t take me in.&nbsp; When you say
you&rsquo;re serious is jest when you&rsquo;re trying to
chaff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told me so up at Paddington, at any, rate,&rdquo;
she declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Friend of mine is in one of the head
offices, and he assured me it was a positive fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two held further conversation as the horse, arrived on the
level, jogged on again; she held the reins whilst he noted in his
pocket-book some names and addresses which remained in her
memory.&nbsp; Woods, greatly disturbed, had to be reminded by
her, when the destination was reached, of the formality of
collecting fares.</p>
<p>Within the space of a fortnight confirmation came.&nbsp; Down
at the railway station small posters were exhibited, and quite a
crowd assembled to read them and to chaff Woods on the disaster
awaiting him, it being a notorious fact that nothing so much
cheers A, B, C, and D as to discover that E is on the edge of
calamity.&nbsp; On blank walls along the route the bills
appeared.&nbsp; At Mrs. Jarrett&rsquo;s Tea Gardens&mdash;this
proved the most stinging smack&mdash;a new board was erected
bearing the words:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Terminus for Motor
Omnibuses</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Woods, with a set face, ordered the full strength of his
stables to assemble at the station on the first morning to meet
the train due just before eleven.&nbsp; The flies and wagonettes
took up position; the large new omnibus, on rushing up with
uniformed driver and boy conductor, found itself obliged to be
satisfied with a place near the cloakroom entrance.&nbsp; As
passengers came out Woods and his men attacked them much in the
way that highwaymen would have behaved a hundred years
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixpence all the way!&rdquo; they shouted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here you are, lady!&nbsp; Cheaper than the motor!&nbsp;
Here you are, lady, sixpence all the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the fierce onslaught was an error in tactics.&nbsp;
Perhaps it would have been wiser not to draw attention to the
presence of a swifter mode of conveyance.&nbsp; Perhaps the
natural independence of Londoners induced them to consider before
coming to a decision.&nbsp; A messenger sent to the new omnibus
returned with the news that the fare was
eightpence&mdash;fourpence cheaper than the old fare, but
obviously twopence dearer than Mr. Woods&rsquo;s new tariff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s worth it!&rdquo; cried young
ladies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do let&rsquo;s go by motor.&nbsp; We shall
get there ever so much quicker.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Woods
likened them, rather bitterly, to sheep.&nbsp; On the two first
passengers clambering up to the outside seats the others made a
quick rush to secure the remaining places; the inside was filled
by those who did not wish to separate from friends, and the new
omnibus, after half a minute of irresolution that almost induced
Woods to believe in the efficacy of prayer, flew away through the
station gates and up the main street of the village, and away out
of sight.&nbsp; His men gathered around Mr. Woods and prophesied
a breakdown; made recommendations.&nbsp; He ordered them to do
nothing but obey orders, and went off to sulk in the smoke-room
of the Railway Hotel.</p>
<p>From which tent he was summoned an hour and a half later by a
constable of the town, who said definitely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Woods, sir, this won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; commanded the fly proprietor irritably;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t sympathy I&rsquo;m giving, it&rsquo;s a
warning.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t call your men off, we shall end
in a riot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Woods delivered an address after the second motor-omnibus had
been allowed to leave the yard with its passengers.&nbsp; The
early part of the speech was of an intimate nature and described
the treatment to be served out in the case of the staff again
disregarding instructions; the punishments ranged from <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>skinning
alive to instant dismissal.&nbsp; In the second part, he ordered
one to run up to the signwriter in the village.&nbsp; Later, the
procession of flies and wagonettes left the station bearing
notices, &ldquo;Ruined by Unfair Competition,&rdquo; and Woods
had the satisfaction of noting that shopkeepers on the line of
route came out to inspect; this would have proved more comforting
if they had given any additional signs of interest.&nbsp; The
procession went at a gallop on noting that away in the distance
the second omnibus had stopped, with driver and conductor busy at
the front, passengers looking over anxiously.&nbsp; Mr. Woods
counted it as part of his luck that as the first wagonette
arrived the new conveyance re-started.&nbsp; When, farther on, a
man walking shouted an inquiry regarding cats&rsquo; meat, he
found it difficult not to make use of the whip.</p>
<p>The Tea Gardens had flags waving at the entrance and along by
the hedge in honour of the occasion; a photographer was giving
considerable attention to the task of securing a good picture of
the motor-omnibus with Mrs. Jarrett and her nieces at the
side.&nbsp; The artist said, &ldquo;Now, please!&rdquo; and at
that moment the horse driven by Mr. Woods became unmanageable,
causing the ladies to cry, &ldquo;O&mdash;ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the animal regained self-control, Woods mentioned that it
was no doubt wise to obtain the photograph ere anything amiss <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>happened to
the new conveyances.&nbsp; The motor-man demanded to know what
was meant by this.&nbsp; Woods replied that he always meant what
he said.&nbsp; Motor-man, temper already acutely tried, declared
it would be a keen pleasure to punch Mr. Woods&rsquo;s
nose.&nbsp; Woods retorted that this job required the complete
abilities of a man, and was not therefore within the power of the
omnibus-driver.&nbsp; The other took off his reefer jacket,
ordering the conductor, to take charge of the garment; Woods,
forgetting his recent disapproval of militant tactics, laid his
hat on the grass at the side of the road.&nbsp; At the first
blow, Mrs. Jarrett ran forward crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t hurt him!&nbsp; You please
mustn&rsquo;t hurt him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt him, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said the flushed and excited Mr. Woods; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only
going to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t him I&rsquo;m nervous about,&rdquo; she
wailed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Woods put on his hat, looked around in a dazed, sheepish way,
and, with a jerk of his head, ordered his men to follow him back
to the stables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said appealingly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want you to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;what else is there
to do?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m prepared to listen to anything
reasonable.&nbsp; Especially,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;coming from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>They
consulted apart, the nieces and the men and a few villagers
looking on eagerly, and evidently wishing that their powers of
hearing were finer.&nbsp; Woods, pinching his under-lip, said he
doubted whether there was anything in the idea, but he felt
willing to give it a trial.&nbsp; And did she&mdash;lowering his
voice&mdash;did she really mean what she said just now?&nbsp;
Mrs. Jarrett, pleating her apron, urged it was unfair to make any
one responsible for a remark made on the spur of the moment, and
re-stated her suggestion.&nbsp; One of the nieces fetched an
inkstand, and, the cards being reversed, with a sharpened piece
of wood she wrote upon them:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">An Hour&rsquo;s Excursion through the</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Forest</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">One
Shilling</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Put the nosebags on!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>It was on the evening of that day that the earthquake, faintly
hinted at near the railway station, broke out in another
place.&nbsp; The wagonettes had been fairly well
patronised.&nbsp; A few couples, down with the announced
intention of enjoying a good long walk through the forest,
changed their minds and accepted carriage exercise as a
substitute.&nbsp; Woods, before going home, shook hands with the
ladies, and pointed out that <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>everything in this world dried
straight if you only gave it time and fair weather.&nbsp; The
motor-driver on his last journey brought, as a peace offering,
two cigars presented by a grateful passenger.&nbsp; One of these
Mr. Woods was smoking near the stables as he waited for his
housekeeper&rsquo;s summons to the evening meal: she was a good
woman, honest and religious, but apparently had never learned to
tell the time by the clock.&nbsp; He was, I say, smoking; he was
also thinking&mdash;a frequent conjunction.</p>
<p>When a tremendous clatter and hubbub came, arousing him, and
causing him to say distractedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever fresh is a &rsquo;appening of now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out in the roadway a set of a dozen women, including the most
notable female inhabitants of the village, marched, his
sister-in-law at the head, banging as they went on dustpans, old
teatrays, saucepans, and other instruments of music rarely to be
discovered in a first-class orchestra.&nbsp; The aim seemed to be
discord, and that end was certainly being achieved.&nbsp; Some
children followed, making a cloud of dust as they slouched
along.&nbsp; The marchers disappeared.&nbsp; Woods, regarding
them as they went, knew the incident to represent a violent
outbreak of moral indignation, and reckoned it a good answer to
the complaint made by an American that day to the effect that
English country life <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>appeared dull.&nbsp; His housekeeper
came, announcing, with a severe air of promptitude, the readiness
of a meal that was three-quarters of an hour late, and appeared
willing for conversation; but he told her he had enjoyed enough
of talk.&nbsp; What he desired now was peace and quietness.</p>
<p>Consequently, news only came to him at six in the morning when
his men arrived at the stables.&nbsp; Having gathered the fact
that Jane had locked her daughter out the previous evening, he
left them at once and ran across to his sister-in-law&rsquo;s
cottage: there the dogged, sulky, half-dressed woman refused to
share responsibility for her actions with any one, and he
expressed, not for the first time, an earnest wish that his
brother had been spared.&nbsp; He hurried agitatedly down to the
Tea Gardens, where Mrs. Jarrett was whitening, at this early
hour, the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said, rising.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fancy you catching me like this, with my hair in
curlers!&nbsp; The girl came here last night, and we hadn&rsquo;t
gone to bed because of the noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The noise going by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swallowed something.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, stopping
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Woods expressed a desire to engage in the wholesale trade of
breaking necks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I let her come in, and if her mother doesn&rsquo;t
want her back, why, she can stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>He
glanced up at the signboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara Jarrett, proprietress,&rdquo; he said
deliberately, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the best little woman
I&rsquo;ve ever come across as yet, and if you think I shall make
a pretty fair sort of a husband I wish you&rsquo;d just say the
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity, dear, about the
motor-omnibuses,&rdquo; she remarked later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrote off last night,&rdquo; said Mr. Woods, with the
wink of a business man, &ldquo;to buy some shares in the
concern!&rdquo;</p>

179</span>XIII&mdash;IRENE MERCER</h2>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> general feeling was that Jane would be
more convenient, that Mary made less demand on the brain, that
Ellen had the advantage of having been the title of her immediate
predecessor, but she proved stern and adamant in regard to the
detail, and the graceful thing to do was to give in for the
moment with a secret promise to make an alteration later
on.&nbsp; When the time came for revision, it was found that no
other title but that of Irene could possibly be given.&nbsp; The
name fitted as though she had been measured for it.&nbsp; An
impression that it could only belong to stately and slightly
offended young women on the pages of sixpenny fashion journals,
vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Previous to me coming here,&rdquo; Irene sometimes
explained in the minute and a half given to conversation whilst
clearing breakfast, &ldquo;I was in a business
establishment.&nbsp; Two year I put in there, I did, and then my
&rsquo;ealth give <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>way.&nbsp; Otherwise I should never have dreamt of
going into domestic service.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been used to
&rsquo;aving my evenings to myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By chance, it was ascertained that the time which elapsed
after leaving school had been devoted to a mineral water
manufactory: this discovery reflected no credit upon any of the
boarders, being indeed the result of a chance remark made by her
on seeing a two-horse cart belonging to the firm go through the
square.&nbsp; A closer reticence was shown in regard to her
family; Irene did, however, convey, at times, a hint that the
members had seen better and more prosperous days, and that
distinguished ancestors would betray signs of restlessness did
they become aware that she occupied a position that brought in
but &pound;12 a year, giving freedom only on Thursday evening and
alternate Sunday afternoons.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we never know
what&rsquo;s in store for us,&rdquo; she remarked, with a touch
of fatalism.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all ordained, I
suppose.&nbsp; What I mean to say is, everything&rsquo;s planned
out, only that we don&rsquo;t know it.&nbsp; Just as well,
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her appearance in the earlier days gave no signal of noble
birth.&nbsp; She wore the corkscrew curls fashionable in her
neighbourhood, and her efforts in hairdressing ceased at about
half-way to the back of her head; the rest being a casual knot
insecurely tied.&nbsp; Many things go awry in this world, but few
were <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>so
unlucky as Irene&rsquo;s apron, which appeared to be the sport
and play of chance, going to various points of the compass,
sometimes becoming fixed due west.&nbsp; She seemed to have a
prejudice against safety pins.&nbsp; With her, hooks and eyes
lived indiscriminately, and never as precise, well-ordered
couples.&nbsp; On first assuming the white cap (against the use
of which she made desperate opposition), she wore it rakishly
over one eye, and being reproved, answered lightly that this was
one of those matters which would be forgotten a hundred years
hence.&nbsp; A girl more completely furnished with the easy
platitudes that turn away wrath surely never existed.&nbsp; In
generous mood, she gave them away by the dozen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One &rsquo;alf of the world doesn&rsquo;t know how the
other &rsquo;alf lives; it&rsquo;s a poor &rsquo;eart that never
rejoices; there&rsquo;s none so blind as them that won&rsquo;t
see; a bird in the &rsquo;and&rsquo;s worth two in the bush; and
that&rsquo;s all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You must not assume that Irene gave up a large amount of her
time to conversation.&nbsp; She started work at twenty to seven
in the morning, and if half-past four in the afternoon found her
ready (in her own phrase) to pop upstairs and change, she counted
she had scored a victory.&nbsp; After tea came duties of a more
leisurely nature such as ironing, and later still&mdash;if luck
favoured&mdash;a brief opportunity for the study of literature,
from which she came in such a dazed, confused state of <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>mind, that
for the subsequent twenty minutes she could only give answers
that possessed a conspicuous amount of incoherence.&nbsp; Those
who have seen her with a number of &ldquo;The Belgravia
Novelette&rdquo; report that her lips moved silently as she read
the lines, that her features indicated, unconsciously, the
emotions affecting each character: when a lady had to reject the
advances of some unwelcome suitor (a frequent occurrence in the
world of fiction where Mr. A., liking Miss B., finds this
converted into ardent love when she announces she hates him with
a hate that can never die), then Irene&rsquo;s face showed stern
and uncompromising decision: when a landscape artist proclaimed
an affection he had hitherto concealed, her eyes half closed, and
her head went gently to and fro.</p>
<p>It is likely the pictures which accompanied these agreeable
stories had some influence, although the fact that the people
always wore evening dress prevented Irene from imitating every
detail.&nbsp; The corkscrew curls, brought forward at each side
of the face from a definite and decided parting, were brushed
back.&nbsp; Irene was observed one night at about eight, on her
return from commissariat duties in connection with next
morning&rsquo;s breakfast, staring earnestly at the head which,
in a window, revolved slowly, vanishing and re-appearing with a
fixed, haughty smile.&nbsp; A youth came up and made some
remarks.</p>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you address conversation to any one
what you haven&rsquo;t been introduced to,&rdquo; she ordered,
warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carry your parcel for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied Irene, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
want to lose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth, declining to take this as a repulse, followed, and
Irene&rsquo;s mistress reproved her for entering the house at the
front door when the area gate was open.&nbsp; The very next day a
fresh and daring experiment was made by fixing a white collar
around the neck, and this was succeeded in the evening by a pair
of cuffs.&nbsp; She seemed pleased with the general effect, and
hastened to answer some knocks and rings at the front door
instead of compelling every caller to repeat the summons.&nbsp;
One of these she received with great curtness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the name don&rsquo;t live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon!&rdquo; said a youth&rsquo;s deep
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ve got it wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite likely.&nbsp; Judging from your
appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing any shopping to-night, miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mistress appealed to her by name, and she closed the door,
explaining a few minutes later that she could not help feeling
sorry for the poor fellows who had to sell combs and
hair-brushes; at the same time, they had no right to annoy people
who had work to do beside answering knocks.&nbsp; Later, her
mistress <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>asked her to refrain from singing.&nbsp; Irene&rsquo;s
voice would never have taken her to the concert platform, but her
theory of music was so excellent that it may be worth while to
give some particulars here.&nbsp; When affairs of the world went
crooked, with her mistress temporarily short in temper, streets
becoming muddy directly that the front step had been whitened,
disaster on the stairs with a breakfast tray, then Irene selected
airs of the cheeriest description, bursting into:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Jones, my friend, came round to me,<br
/>
He said, &lsquo;Will you go on the spree?&rsquo;<br />
I answered &lsquo;Yes, of course I will,<br />
That is, if you will pay the bill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and other songs of a rollicking nature.&nbsp; On the other
hand, when the world went smoothly and nothing happened of a
contrary nature and her mistress had given her an egg with her
tea, then Irene&rsquo;s voice came lugubriously up from the
basement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh I ne&rsquo;er shall see my loved one any
mower, <br />
For I&rsquo;m leaving her and Britain&rsquo;s gallant shower, <br
/>
Though my tears are gently falling, yet I hear her voice
a-calling,<br />
But I ne&rsquo;er shall see my loved one any mower.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changes had, as mentioned, been coming over the girl, but they
proved more obvious at the period when the young man referred <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>to adopted
the procedure of waiting outside the house of an evening,
sometimes offering three stamps with the foot, sometimes giving a
whistle, sometimes playing on the railings a mandoline solo,
sometimes, after a wait of three-quarters of an hour, affecting
in an ostentatious way to leave&mdash;when all other plans had
failed&mdash;and bringing Irene up the steps of the area at a
run, and with a call of &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interesting detail about the acquaintance was the perfect
and complete decision arrived at without delay, by Irene.&nbsp;
Other girls, in like case, would probably have assumed an
attitude of indifference in speaking of their young man; might
have suggested that they would require much persuasion before
consenting to give their hand; would certainly have conveyed the
impression that the capture of their heart was a task not easily
effected.&nbsp; Irene, from a fortnight after the meeting outside
the hairdresser&rsquo;s shop, made no attempt to hide the fact
that she fully intended to marry Mr. Easter.&nbsp; I have often
wondered whether he made a formal proposal, or whether it was
assumed on both sides that this could be taken for granted: there
are some matters on which one cannot interrogate a lady, and, if
she does not give the information spontaneously, the particulars
have to be guessed.&nbsp; In other respects, there seemed no
reason to complain <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>of want of candour.&nbsp; Irene chaffed herself quite
openly.&nbsp; If she forgot to furnish a cup and saucer with a
spoon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of being in love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she omitted to place the toast-rack on the breakfast
table:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sooner I get married and settled down the better for
all parties!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irene, on the Sunday afternoon when he proposed to take her
for the first time to see his people, started out looking like a
composite photograph, for every lady in the boarding-house, from
her mistress in the basement upward, had made some loan or gift,
and many of the adornments had a familiar appearance.&nbsp; No
one could blame her for opening the striped parasol, although the
sun was absent; a muff carried by the other hand and wrist showed
that no weather would find her unprepared.&nbsp; Young Easter
stood at the corner of the first turning, and, in his case, a
necktie showed a vivacious spirit of adventure.&nbsp; A row of
white caps watched from area railings as they met, noted that a
bowler hat was lifted, polite offer to carry the muff,
consultation regarding the method of conveyance.&nbsp; They went
off arm-in-arm, Irene tripping in the effort to keep step, and
any one, starting out five minutes later, could have followed the
scent, and tracked both to the destination by the combined odour
of lavender-water and eau de cologne.</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; reported Irene, the next day,
&ldquo;I can always make myself at &rsquo;ome with
strangers.&nbsp; The old lady&mdash;his mother&mdash;seemed
inclined to be a bit stand-offish at the start, but I said
something pleasant about the jam and after that&mdash;well, you
can generally get over &rsquo;em with a little artfulness.&nbsp;
Tact is everything in this world.&nbsp; Besides, civility costs
nothing.&nbsp; At any, rate, he seemed satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new independence of manner appeared, but only on Friday
mornings, and this was probably due to the increased conceit
effected by young Easter&rsquo;s compliments of the night
before.&nbsp; Her curtness towards messengers from shops on these
occasions was painful to regard: postmen offering remarks as she
knelt at the steps in the early hours went on with the abashed
air of those who have incurred severe reproof.</p>
<p>A dramatic shock came when the month&rsquo;s notice had nearly
expired, that must have reinforced the girl&rsquo;s confidence in
&ldquo;The Belgravia Novelette,&rdquo; and its amazing habit of
altering the situation by the wave of a fairy wand.&nbsp; She
made a slight blunder by reading the letter without any
exhibition of an agonised mind, but a moment&rsquo;s
consideration remedied this, and, if all I heard was true, she
eventually overdid the tragic intensity required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh heavens!&rdquo; she murmured brokenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh my!&nbsp; Oh dear!&nbsp; Has it come to this?&nbsp; <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>What is
there to live for now?&nbsp; Oh! I think I shall go out of my
mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, child!&rdquo; ordered her mistress,
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make yourself ill if you go on
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go away and leave me to die.&nbsp; Oh, only leave
me alone!&nbsp; Frank, Frank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you carry on in this fashion,&rdquo; declared her
mistress, &ldquo;I shall simply take you by the shoulders and
give you a thorough good shaking.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I shall
give to you, miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it, ma&rsquo;am, read it, read it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mistress, having complied with this request, assured her
that, so far as she could understand, the letter contained
important news, but nothing to justify the hysterical
outburst.&nbsp; Irene, recovering partial serenity of manner,
explained, and the other, reading the letter again, admitted
there was something in the girl&rsquo;s view, and that the fact
of young Easter being taken into partnership by an uncle whose
health was failing, might well result in the breaking off of the
engagement; the two found common ground in condemning the
variability of man, and the pernicious influence of success upon
some minds.&nbsp; The girl gave a brief rehearsal of her share in
the interview that was to take place that evening, from which it
appeared that young Easter would have little to do but listen, to
mumble ineffective excuses, to retire finally <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>carrying
the knowledge that Irene would not now consent to marry him,
though he should come to her on hands and knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him &rsquo;ave it straight, I will!&rdquo; cried
Irene.&nbsp; &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t play about and make a fool
of me.&nbsp; May think they can, but I&rsquo;ll jolly soon let
&rsquo;em know they&rsquo;ve made a mistake.&nbsp; Shan&rsquo;t
talk much, mind you, but what I do say will go right
&rsquo;ome.&nbsp; Least said, soonest mended!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was expected she would return within twenty minutes after
leaving the house; instead, ten o&rsquo;clock struck as her knock
came, and this was not her usual single knock, but represented
the music of a triumphant dance.&nbsp; The fault for imagining
disaster she imputed to her mistress, who seemed to lack the gift
of comprehending a well and clearly expressed letter.&nbsp; Mr.
Easter had no idea of backing out of the engagement; on the
contrary, he wished her, in the new circumstances, to make some
more elaborate investments at certain of the best shops in the
neighbourhood, and this represented his uncle&rsquo;s desire as
well as his own.</p>
<p>Irene&rsquo;s mistress tells me she had given up all thoughts
and hopes of seeing her again when, being away in the north of
London, and desiring to return with all despatch, she managed by
standing in front of a conveyance to stop it.&nbsp; Passengers on
the left reluctantly made room: the young woman next to whom <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>she sat
begged pardon coldly, and carefully shielded skirts.&nbsp;
Recognition came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a very small world it is!&rdquo; said Irene, in a
high voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;How most extraordinary you and I should
run across each other again!&nbsp; And tell me,&rdquo;
condescendingly, &ldquo;you are getting on pretty well?&nbsp; So
glad!&nbsp; What a great convenience these motor omnibuses must
be to poor people; I suppose you often travel in them.&nbsp; Do
you know, I couldn&rsquo;t get a taxi when I wanted one just now,
couldn&rsquo;t get one for love or money.&nbsp; My husband will
be so annoyed when I tell him about it.&nbsp; I get out
here.&nbsp; Three At Homes to go to.&nbsp; Goodbye!&rdquo;</p>

193</span>XIV&mdash;YOUNG NUISANCES</h2>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> three had done nearly everything
forbidden by the company&rsquo;s notices, and as the train slowed
in order to stop at a junction, they expressed a fierce
determination to reserve the compartment for the rest of the
journey.&nbsp; If any one touched the handle they would fetch him
(or her) such a rap across the knuckles as wouldn&rsquo;t make
him (or her) half scream.&nbsp; They were still discussing plans
of defence when the train came to a crowded platform; the three
rushed to the door and side windows, shouting an assurance that
there was no room, that the door was locked, that the compartment
had been specially reserved.&nbsp; A short struggle, and
determined travellers made their way in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young hussies!&rdquo; exclaimed a brown-faced woman
wrathfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never saw such impudence in all my life
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;They come down,&rdquo; said another,
&ldquo;these yer London schoolchildren, and they kick up such a
deuce and all of a shindy that everybody in the village begs and
prays they&rsquo;ll never be allowed to come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the manners they learn our youngsters!&rdquo;
remarked a third.&nbsp; &ldquo;The expressions!&nbsp; The
sayings!&nbsp; The tunes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The country&rsquo;s no fit place for &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
declared the brown-faced woman emphatically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m strongly in favour of every one keeping
themselves to themselves.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never so much as
thought of going up to London myself.&nbsp; Sooner see myself
dead and in my grave and buried, I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One admitted she went up twice a year, but pleaded, in
extenuation, that she had a sister in service at Highbury, and
invariably brought home enough small suits and dresses to enable
her eight children to attract a fair amount of attention at the
Congregational Chapel.&nbsp; Conversation went on to safer
grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All finished?&rdquo; asked the shortest of the three
London children presently.&nbsp; The ladies sniffed and declined
to answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Cos if so, perhaps you won&rsquo;t
mind if we say a word.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t come here for a
week&rsquo;s &rsquo;oliday to please ourselves; we don&rsquo;t
come down here for the benefit of our &rsquo;ealth; we come down
so as to brighten you up a bit, and give you a chance
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mixing with intelligent people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; she ordered to her
companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
addressed the women again.&nbsp; &ldquo;To give you a chance of
seeing what a lot of pudden-headed fools you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passengers, trembling with annoyance, whispered a
recommendation that no notice should be taken of these remarks;
the brown-faced woman could not, however, refrain from hinting at
a course of procedure which would be adopted were the child one
of hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea is this,&rdquo; went on the short girl, with
the patient air of endeavouring to make a complicated matter
clear to defective intellects.&nbsp; &ldquo;You dawdle about
every day of your lives, seeing nothing, &rsquo;earing nothing,
doing nothing.&nbsp; You very seldom speak, and when you do you
talk in such a peculiar style that you can&rsquo;t possibly
understand one another.&nbsp; So the County Council comes to us
and it says, &lsquo;Miss Parkes,&rsquo; or whatever our name
happens to be, &lsquo;sorry to trouble, but you&rsquo;ll shortly
be taking your &rsquo;olidays, and will you be so kind and so
obliging as to go down to such-and-such a place, and do all you
can to liven it up.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s asking you a great
deal,&rsquo; says the County Council, &lsquo;but the Fund is very
keen about it, and if you can spare the time, and if you&rsquo;ve
got the willingness, why,&rsquo; says the County Council,
&lsquo;we shall look on it as a great favour!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;And make it worth your
while,&rsquo;&rdquo; suggested her companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll biff you two,&rdquo; she threatened,
&ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t keep quiet when I&rsquo;m
talking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The daringness of the child!&rdquo; exclaimed the rest
of the compartment, amazedly and heatedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a single word of truth
in what she says!&nbsp; The trollops!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Facts are facts,&rdquo; she said, smoothing her brief
skirt, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s very little use pretending you can
get away from them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no pleasure to me to have to
tell you all this, but it&rsquo;s only right you should
know.&nbsp; As for us finding any satisfaction coming to these
&rsquo;eaven-forsaken places&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed scornfully, and because her two companions did not
join in this ordered them to wake up and sing something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; threatened the brown-faced woman
solemnly, &ldquo;I shall most certainly report you to the guard
at the next station.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s agenst the by-laws, and you
can be punished for doing it.&nbsp; Punished well.&nbsp; My
eldest boy is going on the line when he leaves school, and it
stands to reason I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.&nbsp; So
you just dare, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They allowed one station to go before beginning, and during
the half-minute of rest there chaffed an official until he became
scarlet with confusion.&nbsp; On the train re-starting, the <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>three
lifted their voices to shrill music, singing a satirical melody
with, for last line of the refrain, &ldquo;Oh, what a jolly place
is Engeland.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was followed by a song that caused
the other passengers to gaze steadily at the roof of the
compartment; the girls did not conceal their diversion at the
sensitive nature of the country mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we give &rsquo;em next?&rdquo; asked the
eldest girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit and let me think,&rdquo; answered the
youngest.</p>
<p>The women said that by rights Parliament ought to step
in.&nbsp; If Parliament once decided that these common, vulgar
children were not to be allowed, even once a year, to come down
into the country and make themselves a nuisance, then it would be
stopped.&nbsp; It only needed that Parliament should say the
word.&nbsp; Parliament would have to be spoken to about it.&nbsp;
Parliament busied its head concerning a lot of things which did
not matter; but here was a subject Parliament might well tackle,
and thus earn the grateful thanks of a nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the youngest,
&ldquo;one of them songs we&rsquo;ve been learnin&rsquo; at
school lately.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t room, or else we&rsquo;d
do one of the Morris dances.&nbsp; That&rsquo;d make &rsquo;em
open their eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first verse the brown-faced woman put down her basket
and gave all her <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>attention.&nbsp; As the refrain began she unconsciously
nodded her bonnet to the rhythm.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where are you going to, my pretty
maid?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are you going, my honey?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Going over the hills, kind sir,&rsquo; she said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;To my father a-mowing the
barley!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Why, do you know,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I &rsquo;ent
heard that not since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order, there!&rdquo; commanded the girl
imperatively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some of you&rsquo;ll get chucked out
if you don&rsquo;t keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last verse came to the deeply interested compartment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And now she is the lawyer&rsquo;s wife, <br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dearly the lawyer loves her;<br />
They live in a happy content of life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And well in the station above her.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The women clapped hands.&nbsp; One remembered her grandmother
singing it years and years and years ago; another had heard it
once and only once, at a Foresters&rsquo; f&ecirc;te; a third had
always recollected the air, but the words she could not have
recalled though you offered her a pension.&nbsp; The London
children, touched by the genuine enthusiasm, sang &ldquo;Blow
Away the Morning Dew&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Two
Magicians.&rdquo;&nbsp; The audience pressed apples upon
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re never getting out here, my <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>dears?&rdquo; protested the brown-faced woman.&nbsp;
They assured her this was their destination.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
then,&rdquo; taking up her heavy basket, &ldquo;dang it
all&mdash;it only means a extra fowermile walk for me&mdash;if I
don&rsquo;t get out with you, just for the pleasure of your
company!&rdquo;</p>

203</span>XV&mdash;MY BROTHER EDWARD</h2>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span><span
class="smcap">The</span> case of my brother Edward is typical of
many, and I set the facts down here, partly as reminder to
myself, mainly for the information of the public.&nbsp; I said
once, when in the company of some other bright spirits, that the
pupils of yesterday are the teachers of to-morrow, by which
remark I meant to convey that we learn in our youth, and in our
middle age become, in turn, the instructors.&nbsp; Poor Edward
had the same advantages that came to me in school days, the very
same advantages.&nbsp; Our mother consulted us in turn; I, the
elder, decided, without hesitation, to go into the City; Edward,
a year later, suggested that he should go into an engineering
place at Wandsworth, on the other side of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I said when I reached home that
night.&nbsp; &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do at all.&nbsp; Choose a
refined occupation.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want all Fulham to think
that the sweeps are <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>continually coming in and going out
of the house.&nbsp; We may have our faults, but no one can say
that we haven&rsquo;t always worn a clean collar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep mine for Sundays,&rdquo; remarked
Edward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;please let it be
understood that this is a matter which concerns me to some
extent.&nbsp; Supposing I wished to bring home a friend from
Bucklersbury, and supposing that just as I opened the front gate
Edward came along.&nbsp; How should I be able to
explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; suggested Edward, &ldquo;that I was going
in for Christy Minstrel business in my spare time.&nbsp; Say I
was just off to St. James&rsquo;s Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I place my veto on the scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can place whatever you like,&rdquo; he retorted,
&ldquo;and it won&rsquo;t make any difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;very well.&nbsp; In
that case I consider myself relieved of all responsibility.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve done with it.&nbsp; Only, mind this, don&rsquo;t come
to me in after years&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And complain that I omitted to give you advice.&nbsp;
Mother, you&rsquo;re a witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put my silk hat on and went out of the house.&nbsp; I have
always been willing to give people the benefit of my counsel, but
the moment I find they cease to be receptive I&mdash;to use a
vulgarism&mdash;dry up.</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>I
discovered a certain amount of satisfaction in observing that
events shaped somewhat in accordance with my prophecy.&nbsp; So
soon as my voice settled down I was asked to join a Choral Union
in Walham Green; and on the second evening, as I escorted two
ladies in the direction of their home, I met Edward&mdash;Edward
on the way from work, and presenting the appearance of a
half-caste nigger.&nbsp; He raised his cap, and I had to explain
to my companions that he was a lad to whom my people had been
able to show some kindness, taking him in hand when he was quite
young.&nbsp; Unfortunately, one of the ladies knew him, and knew
his name, and I found it advisable not to go to any more
rehearsals of &ldquo;The Wreck of the
<i>Hesperus</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Months afterwards, when I had left
home and was living in lodgings owing to a dispute with mother
about coming home late at night, he and some of his
fellow-workmen arrived at the offices in Bucklersbury to fit up
the electric light, which had then just come in, and I had to
take an early opportunity of mentioning to him, privately, that
if he claimed relationship with me he would be doing the very
worst turn that a man could do to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you hanged first!&rdquo; said Edward, taking his
coat off to begin work.&nbsp; I turned cold at the sight of his
shirt-sleeves of flannel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it necessary that I should <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>appeal to
your better instincts.&nbsp; I implore you, Edward, to remember
that the ties of relationship can exist, but need
not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ll see
you hanged first before I confess to any one here that you are a
brother of mine.&nbsp; Providing, of course&rdquo;&mdash;here he
threw back his head and laughed in a loud, common
way&mdash;&ldquo;providing the Governor of Newgate allows me to
be present at the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt greatly relieved at this, but now and again, while the
work was going on in the office, Edward gave me a start by
talking in an audible voice to the other workmen about his
relatives, and I knew he did this purposely.&nbsp; What I feared
was that his companions might speak to him by his surname; it
proved reassuring to find that they called him Teddy.&nbsp; On
the night they finished the work, I happened to be staying
overtime, and, taking him aside, I tried to talk pleasantly to
him, asking how he progressed in the new business to which he had
transferred himself, and pointing out that a rolling stone
gathered no moss, but he seemed quite off-hand in his
manner.&nbsp; I offered him sixpence that he might go out and get
a drink.&nbsp; He said that I had better keep it and buy
something to put in my face; he added that I appeared to be
spending all my money on clothes, and expressed doubts whether I
had enough to eat.</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>&ldquo;Pardon me, Edward,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are
now trespassing on grounds that do not belong to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A family weakness,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good-night, old man!&nbsp; Good luck to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is not luck which
counts in this world, but rather a steady, dogged determination
to do one&rsquo;s duty; a persistent effort to keep one&rsquo;s
position in society; to mingle, so far as possible, with those of
a superior station in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I think of you?&rdquo; he interrupted
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing more nor less
than&mdash;&nbsp; Perhaps I&rsquo;d better not say what I was
going to say.&nbsp; After all, we&rsquo;re brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, Edward,&rdquo; I said, in my quiet way, turning
to go, so that it might finish the discussion&mdash;&ldquo;that
is a fact which I sometimes find it difficult to
realise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>On reflection, I perceived that, disturbing as this argument
had been, there was no reason to allow it to cause regret, for it
meant a final breaking up of friendship, and enabled me to find
good plea for not acknowledging his existence should we ever meet
again.&nbsp; Moreover, increases had been stopped in the office,
and it appeared likely that I might remain at &pound;110 a year
for a time.&nbsp; Unless I could find some one of a <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>fairly
attractive appearance, with a little money of her own, it would
inconvenience me greatly to contribute anything towards the
support of my mother.&nbsp; This difference of opinion with
Edward provided me with a good answer if ever the application
should be made.&nbsp; &ldquo;After what Edward remarked to me
some time ago,&rdquo; I should say, &ldquo;I must decline to have
anything to do with domestic expenses.&nbsp; He is living in the
house: let him provide the sums necessary for the upkeep of the
establishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; As it proved, no necessity existed
for this statement, because they very wisely refrained from
making any appeal.</p>
<p>I heard of Edward occasionally by the medium of Miss
Charlesworth; she also brought me news of my mother.&nbsp; I was
living then in Jubilee Place, and Miss Charlesworth&rsquo;s
people kept a large dairy in King&rsquo;s Road, Chelsea.&nbsp; I
called in sometimes on my way home for a couple of fresh
eggs.&nbsp; Eggs can be carried in the pocket without
observation, and, if folk are careful not to crowd, without
damage, whilst other eatables have to be conveyed in a
parcel.&nbsp; I had strong objections to be seen carrying a
package of any kind.</p>
<p>Miss Charlesworth took music-lessons from my mother in the old
days when there was not much money about, and I always spoke
pleasantly when I called at the dairy, answering her when she
asked whether there <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>was anything special in the evening
papers; I talked to her across the milk-pans, if I could spare
the time, about Gilbert and Sullivan&rsquo;s new play at the
&ldquo;Savoy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her mother beamed through the glass
half of the door at the back, and on one occasion asked me to
step in and have a bite of supper.&nbsp; I declined the first
invitation, and this caused Miss Charlesworth&rsquo;s mother to
become exceedingly anxious that I should honour them with my
company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix your own evening,&rdquo; urged the old lady:
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re plain people, but we always keep a good
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found that, in the interests of economy, the plan, once
started, answered very well.&nbsp; At first, when Miss
Charlesworth&rsquo;s mother found that I walked into the
shop-parlour nearly every night at supper-time, she exhibited
signs of impatience, putting an extra plate down with a bang, and
throwing a thick tumbler towards me with the word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the attentions I paid to her plump daughter mollified her,
and she always cried when I sang &ldquo;The Anchor&rsquo;s
Weighed.&rdquo;&nbsp; From Lily&mdash;one could but smile at the
ludicrous inappropriateness of the name&mdash;I heard that my
brother Edward had been foolhardy enough to start an electric
light business on his own account; and, in spite of the
differences that had taken place between us, I could not help <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>feeling
annoyed that he had omitted to ask my advice before taking such a
step.&nbsp; It would be of no advantage to me for people to find
the name of my brother in the list of bankruptcies.</p>
<p>I can never understand how it was that I allowed myself to be
imposed upon by the Charlesworths.&nbsp; In the City at that time
I had the reputation of being as keen as any one in the office,
where my own interests were concerned; there were complaints that
I shirked some of my duties, and that I often shifted
responsibility from my own shoulders, but no one ever accused me
of being a fool.&nbsp; These two women at the dairy-shop in
King&rsquo;s Road, as nearly as possible, took me in.&nbsp; It
hurt me very much afterwards to think of the time I had
wasted.&nbsp; If I took Lily Charlesworth to one place of
interest, I took her to a dozen; the National Gallery on a free
day, the Tower, the outside of the Lyceum Theatre, the South
Kensington Museum&mdash;any man, young at the time, and in
receipt of a stationary income can fill in the list.&nbsp; Now
and again she wanted to talk about my brother Edward; I changed
the subject adroitly, for I could not trust my temper where he
was concerned.&nbsp; It was near the Albert Memorial one evening
(she had seen it before, but, as I said, it could do her no harm
to see it again) that I directed conversation to the subject of
profits made <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>on milk and cream; the discussion began at a quarter
past seven, and the information I obtained was satisfactory
enough to induce me, at twenty minutes to eight, to make a
definitely worded offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very kind of you to ask me,&rdquo; she said nervously,
&ldquo;but I think my answer must be &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; I said pleasantly,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no occasion for all this coyness.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said rapidly, &ldquo;friends.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s just it.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s no reason why we
shouldn&rsquo;t go on being friends.&nbsp; But nothing more,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;if you will allow me to
say so, Lily, verges on stupidity.&nbsp; I dare say you feel that
you are not worthy of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May, I ask what other reason can possibly
exist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me one,&rdquo; I insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said deliberately&mdash;&ldquo;I
rather think I am going to marry your brother Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I threw up my hands with a gesture of sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor, silly girl!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
ever has induced you to think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>I
turned away from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was because he asked us to be kind to you,&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;that me and mother took the trouble to look
after you of an evening.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s kept you out of
mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re aware that he&rsquo;s marrying
you for the sake of your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think he is,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must say this for myself: that I kept wonderfully calm,
considering the trying nature of the circumstances.&nbsp; It
appeared that, although her mother&rsquo;s name showed over the
dairy, she was only the manager, working at a salary.&nbsp; I
pointed out that this should have been mentioned to me
before.&nbsp; She answered that Edward was acquainted with the
fact, and there existed no reason why the information should be
communicated to me.</p>
<p>I saw the uselessness of arguing the point, and left her to
make her way home alone, congratulating myself on a narrow
escape.</p>
<p>That night I wrote a rather clever letter to my brother
Edward, the wording of which gave me trouble, but brought
satisfaction; my only fear was that he might not have the
intelligence to read between the lines.&nbsp; I said that I felt
sure Lily Charlesworth would grow up to be the woman her mother
was; he <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>would no doubt be as happy as he deserved to be; I
trusted it would be many weeks ere he discovered the mistake he
had made.&nbsp; For myself, I had long since decided to remain a
bachelor; I hinted that the courage of the family appeared to
have centred itself in him.&nbsp; Begged him to convey my best
regards to my mother, and to express my regret that, on his
marriage, I could not see my way to offering her a home.</p>
<p>Edward sent no answer to this, and he forwarded no invitation
to the wedding.&nbsp; I should not have accepted it; indeed, I
had drafted out a satirical reply, but I do think he might have
sent me a card.&nbsp; I transferred my custom to a dairy in
Brompton Road; and, at about that period, I spoke to a young lady
in Hyde Park, mentioning that it was a fine evening, and that the
days were drawing in.</p>
<p>I may say at once this lady became my wife.&nbsp; It is
unnecessary also that I should delay the information that her
account of relatives, of her position in society, and of herself,
given to me during the days of courtship, differed to a
considerable extent from the details proffered during our
honeymoon at Littlehampton, and this made it easy for me to
explain that one or two exaggerations had somehow crept into the
particulars which I had furnished concerning myself.&nbsp; For
one day, after this, we exchanged no word <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>with each
other; and I have since been inclined to wish that she, at any
rate, had continued this policy of silence, for, later on, she
made remarks which (as I believe I pointed out at the time)
proved her to be wanting in that fine and glorious attribute of
women&mdash;the ability to forgive and forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we must make the best of it,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but I can foresee that the best won&rsquo;t be very
good.&nbsp; And if ever I allow a day to go by without reminding
you of what a bounder you are, then you can assume that I am
going off my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She must have begun at once, for I remember that when I had
struck some items off the bill, and settled with the
Littlehampton boarding-house, the landlady told me that she had
never found herself making such a mistake in the whole course of
her existence: when we first arrived in the cab, she could have
sworn we had not been married long; on retrospection she
perceived that we had been man and wife for at least ten
years.&nbsp; I told her we should never by any chance patronise
her boarding-house again, and she said this assurance robbed the
future of half its terrors.&nbsp; No doubt she thought she had
had the last word, but she little knew the kind of man she was
dealing with; I got the better of her later by recommending some
of my economical friends to go there.</p>
<p>I mention all this because the incident is <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>typical of
others which happened at about this time.&nbsp; At office I
detected a disposition on the part of the firm to promote younger
men over my head, and, when I insisted on knowing the reason,
they fenced with me for some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact is,&rdquo; said one of the partners at last,
&ldquo;you show no interest in your work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it worth my while, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re paying you your full value.&nbsp; You
wouldn&rsquo;t get more for your services anywhere
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite easy for you to test the truth of the
statement,&rdquo; snapped the partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;that means you can
do without me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means we are ready to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told the wife when I reached home, and, after she had
expressed some opinions concerning my conduct, she said that my
best plan would be to write to my brother Edward, and ask him to
use his influence in obtaining for me a new berth.&nbsp; I told
her plainly that I would rather cease work for ever than feel
myself under any obligation to him.&nbsp; When, after replying to
several advertisements, it became clear that some exceptional
step would have to be taken, I submitted an alternative for her
consideration.&nbsp; To show what a difficult woman she was to
deal with (and to throw a light on <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>much that happened afterwards), I
wish to record that she went into one of her fits of temper,
calling me everything but my proper name.&nbsp; Using diplomacy,
I went away for a day or two, and on my return she told me she
had decided to act upon my suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but why not have
agreed to it at first?&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s satisfactory to
see that you have come to your senses.&nbsp; Perhaps another time
that we have a difference of opinion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t trust you,&rdquo; I said severely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These promises of yours mean nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you it won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will leave it at that,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What it all amounts to is this: that you are willing to go
back to your former occupation as lady&rsquo;s-maid in a
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which capacity you will be able to earn enough to
keep the home going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said my wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, dear me,
no!&nbsp; I shall earn enough to keep myself going, but I
shan&rsquo;t bother about you.&nbsp; Understand that, once for
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to look me in the face&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t allow you a penny,&rdquo; she
declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if you find out where I&rsquo;m <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>engaged,
and call round and begin kicking up a row&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall simply come back again,&rdquo; she announced
deliberately, &ldquo;and make you keep me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must have been in consequence of this blow, administered by
one who had sworn to love, honour, and obey me, that I began to
lose heart.&nbsp; I went into a single room, on the other side of
the water, and for a time became interested in political life,
devoting myself more particularly to the Sugar Bounty
Question.&nbsp; To my astonishment, I found that my brother
Edward was paying some attention to a constituency in South
London; as I remarked, rather cleverly, he appeared to have
succeeded in the world as much as I deserved to do.&nbsp; It
became my duty at one of his meetings to put a few searching
questions to him.&nbsp; Some of his supporters objected, and
cried out to me: &ldquo;Who are you; who are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
shouted back that the candidate could give the information if he
cared to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Edward; &ldquo;he is my
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spoke to him after the meeting, and he introduced me to a
slim, good-looking woman&mdash;his wife.&nbsp; I remarked, in her
presence, that he appeared to have found out Miss Charlesworth,
as I had done; he replied <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>that he had not only found her out,
but that he had married her.&nbsp; My amazed look caused Mrs.
Edward to declare she had rarely received such a genuine
compliment, and that it more than repaid her for the course of
persistent exercise on which she had engaged.&nbsp; She added
they had made efforts to discover me&mdash;I knew how much to
believe of that&mdash;and exhibited surprise on hearing that I
was married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We particularly wanted to find you,&rdquo; remarked my
brother Edward, &ldquo;about six months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where was I six
months ago?&nbsp; Busy, I expect.&nbsp; What did you want me
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I&rsquo;d known,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
would have sent a wreath.&nbsp; Got a cigarette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away rather sharply, and then turned to me
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;She wanted to see you,&rdquo; he
remarked.&nbsp; And they both gave their attention to some one
else.</p>
<p>It occurred to me afterwards that they perhaps expected me to
show more signs of distress; if I had thought this at the time I
could have obliged them.&nbsp; But that trifling detail makes no
excuse whatever for Edward&rsquo;s subsequent conduct towards me,
conduct which has compelled me to write this account of his
behaviour.&nbsp; I put it briefly, and I wish to add that I put
it truthfully; <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>there may have been times in my career when it has been
necessary to step with care beyond the confines of exactitude,
but, in regard to this matter, I am telling you nothing that can
be contradicted.</p>
<p>I wrote to him, you must know, immediately after the meeting,
and offered to stop my opposition to his candidature, and to help
him, heart, body, and soul, if he would allow me&mdash;say, two
pounds a week.&nbsp; He replied curtly.&nbsp; I did not apply to
him again for quite ten days, and then I wrote saying that,
although he could not see his way to accepting my first
proposition, perhaps he could let me have a loan.&nbsp; I said I
was temporarily out of a situation, and that several excellent
offers were being made to me.</p>
<p>To keep myself to the truth, I am bound to say that I obtained
from him, at various times, amounts which, totted up, would come
to a respectable figure.</p>
<p>Mark what follows.</p>
<p>This morning&mdash;this very morning&mdash;I receive a
letter.&nbsp; Headed &ldquo;House of Commons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that for some years
past you have done no work of a creditable nature.&nbsp; I am
always willing to help those who are making some effort to earn a
living, but I do nothing for the indolent.&nbsp; I can give you
no further assistance until you obtain work and show some clear
intention of sticking to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>Apart
from the wording of the letter&mdash;inexcusable in one who had
equal educational advantages with myself&mdash;I desire to point
out the callousness of its tone; the disregard of family
ties.&nbsp; I leave the matter for the world to judge.&nbsp; In
the meanwhile, if you know of any one who can be persuaded to
assist by spontaneous gifts, I shall not only be saved the
necessity of looking for employment, but I shall be enabled to
write a sharp, stinging note to my brother Edward.</p>
<h2><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>XVI&mdash;SAVOIR FAIRE</h2>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Aunt</span> kept on saying I
ought to bring her up to London with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
perturbed lad examined closely the peak of his cap.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What the others seeggested was that I should get you to go
down to Railway Terrace and argy it all out with my late
landlady.&nbsp; One of the ticket collectors said there
wasn&rsquo;t nobody on the station who could make himself so
unpleasant as you, Mr. Swan, when you felt so
inclined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do my best,&rdquo; admitted Porter Swan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Nother one recommended you should go down there
and knock at the door and pretend to have had a drop or two too
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why pretend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new porter had endured a hard week; all the tricks of an
inventive staff had been played upon him, and Porter Swan took a
lively interest in these, prompting colleagues to further
efforts.&nbsp; Now that young Mannering <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>arrived
with his troubles and appealed for help, games were set
aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s evidently a terror,&rdquo; admitted Porter
Swan presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d only come and asked
me at the outset I might have told you where to go.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Pon me word, I don&rsquo;t know quite now what to be up
to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said young Mannering
hopelessly, &ldquo;then no one does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not go back and make the best of it for a
while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Swan,&rdquo; declared the youth tearfully, &ldquo;I
do assure you her chops are worse than her vegetables, and her
vegetables worse than her chops.&nbsp; I was bound to
leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want your property, then, without paying too
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rayther get it without paying nothing at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porter Swan went off duty at seven, having first washed with
unusual vigour and changed his official headgear for the bowler
hat of private life.&nbsp; Near the suburban station he bought a
cigar, and, lighting it, strode towards Railway Terrace,
rehearsing the coming debate on the way.&nbsp; At the door of No.
17 he gave a sharp, definite knock and frowned at some children
who ran up to watch the course of events.&nbsp; He had to knock
again, and this time also rattled the flap of the letter-box to
express impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the trim, determined <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>woman at
the open doorway.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you kicking up all this
row for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make any unpleasantness, or any
un-anything else,&rdquo; he began truculently, &ldquo;but
you&rsquo;ve got a tin box belonging to one of our young men, and
I have to request, ma&rsquo;am, that you hand it over to me at
your early convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay me his week&rsquo;s board and lodging, and you can
take not only the tin box, but all that&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goes against the grain,&rdquo; he said loudly,
&ldquo;to argue with a lady, but I ask you one simple
question.&nbsp; Have you, since you&rsquo;ve taken to letting,
ever had a lodger that stayed so long as a month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last two,&rdquo; she replied calmly, &ldquo;stayed
until they got married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have had iron constitutions,&rdquo; he
argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha!&rdquo; she called, turning her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what this gentleman said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as well,&rdquo; she remarked to him,
&ldquo;to have a witness.&nbsp; Makes all the difference in a
court of law.&rdquo;&nbsp; She found her handkerchief.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always made it a special boast that I never had
to tell a lodger to go, and I do think it&rsquo;s
hard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Porter Swan, still
in aggressive tones, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to <a

228</span>quarrel.&nbsp; We want to arrange this trifling affair
in a nice, sensible, amicable way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to settle it,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and make out the bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me understand first of all,&rdquo; repressing
annoyance.&nbsp; &ldquo;What does your claim actually amount
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She mentioned the sum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve got the assurance to stand there and
demand all that for keeping this young country lad for three
days!&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s my opinion you&rsquo;re nothing more
nor less than a female swindler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha!&rdquo; she called.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you still
listening, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porter Swan went on to the house of his own landlady, where he
complained with bitterness of the absence of a mat and the
condition of the wallpaper; she soothed him with a cup of tea so
excellent that it stood outside the pale of criticism.&nbsp; In
his room he used the hair-brush with considerable fierceness, a
process that seemed to arouse ideas, for after a few
moments&rsquo; consideration he changed his collar and fixed a
necktie hitherto reserved for Sundays, Good Friday, and Christmas
Day.&nbsp; Then he set out, whistling as he went, announcing
cheerfully to his landlady that he would return in less than half
an hour.&nbsp; If her husband came in, she was to beg him to stay
up: Porter Swan would have something to relate to him.&nbsp; In
Douglas <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>Street he purchased a threepenny bunch of
chrysanthemums&mdash;all white.</p>
<p>At the door of the house in Railway Terrace he gave this time
a deferential knock.&nbsp; The child answered it, crying to her
mother that the man with the red face had called again.&nbsp;
Swan asked the little girl whether she cared for flowers, and
made a genial presentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to trouble you once more, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he
said, taking off his hat and throwing away the end of the cigar,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve come round to apologise.&nbsp; In the heat
of argument I used one or two remarks I&rsquo;d no business to
use to any lady, and if you&rsquo;ll kindly dismiss them from
your mind I shall esteem it a favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what he&rsquo;s give me, mother,&rdquo; said the
child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sweet-faced little thing,&rdquo; mentioned Swan,
gazing down at the youngster sentimentally.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often thought that if ever I did get
married&mdash;&nbsp; Only&rdquo;&mdash;with a regretful shrug of
the right shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been lucky
enough to find any one that cared for me.&nbsp; That accounts for
my want of good manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a bit noticeable,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s partly, too,&rdquo; he contended, &ldquo;the
result of good nature.&nbsp; This young chap, he appealed to me
to help him, and I, foolish like, consented to do my best.&nbsp;
Never <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>occurred to me that I should be no use at all when I
set myself against the sharpness of a woman.&nbsp; When a
woman&rsquo;s got a clear head and a certain amount of good
looks, no man has the leastest chance.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked
around the passage for a new subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this the
late lamented, may I ask, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Lord Kitchener,&rdquo; she answered, not
displeased.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you care to come in and sit down
for a bit?&nbsp; I expect you&rsquo;re tired, running about all
over the place.&nbsp; Martha dear, you come in, too, and let us
see how nicely you can arrange the flowers.&nbsp; That,&rdquo;
entering the front room and pointing to a large, tinted
photograph, &ldquo;that was Mr. Rickards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sensible sort of forehead,&rdquo; said Porter Swan
guardedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than could be said of what was inside it.&nbsp; He
was always talking about what he&rsquo;d put by in the Railway
Savings Bank, and every pay day he used to come home and say,
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s adding up rapidly,&rsquo; and &lsquo;You
won&rsquo;t want for nothing, my love, if I should be took
away.&rsquo;&nbsp; And,&rdquo; with acerbity, &ldquo;when he did
go off, I found that instead of having about forty pounds
there&mdash;enough to give me the chance of opening a little
business&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t put by as many shillings.&nbsp;
Not as many pence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some men are like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All men are like that,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; protested Swan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got our faults, but we haven&rsquo;t got the
same kind of faults.&nbsp; Most of us are straightforward.&nbsp;
How do you manage to rub along, ma&rsquo;am, if it isn&rsquo;t a
rude question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a rude question; but I do dressmaking, and I take
lodgers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take in lodgers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled, and Swan could not help thinking that only trouble
interfered with her good looks.&nbsp; She sent the child to the
scullery for a jug of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; he insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall
have something with my supper, later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the flowers,&rdquo; as the child
obeyed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t want her to hear what I
was about to tell you,&rdquo; she went on confidentially.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The fact is&mdash;&nbsp; As you say, it has been an
extraordinary autumn.&nbsp; The sun to-day was enough to make
people&rsquo;s eyes ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t spilt a drop,&rdquo; announced the child,
who had returned swiftly.</p>
<p>Swan moved his chair nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got eyes,&rdquo; he said, lowering his
voice, &ldquo;eyes like the head-lights on an engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to frown, and gave a meaning glance in the direction
of the occupied little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be dreamin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em for
weeks,&rdquo; he whispered earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
one to take much notice of females in a general <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>way&mdash;a
woman hater; that&rsquo;s what they call me in the porters&rsquo;
room&mdash;but as I was going to say, I can quite well imagine a
chap like myself, going on for years just racketing about and
then coming across a pair of eyes like yours and saying to
himself, &lsquo;Swan, old man, it&rsquo;s time you began to take
matters seriously!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha, my dear, go on with your work.&nbsp; Me and Mr.
Swan are only talking business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been a decent-looking girl in your
day,&rdquo; Swan went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, time
doesn&rsquo;t stand still with any of us, and very few can
weather the storm, as you may say, without showing some signs of
wear and tear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had more of a struggle than most,&rdquo; she
said, glancing at the mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want somebody to take you out for walks, and now
and again an evening at the theatre.&nbsp; Sometimes I get pit
orders for two, and I tear &rsquo;em up, because,&rdquo; said
Swan, with a touch of melancholy, &ldquo;simply because I
can&rsquo;t get no one to go with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a shame!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely
your landlady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what landladies are,&rdquo; he
interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Always on the make.&nbsp; So long as
they can over-charge you, that&rsquo;s all they want.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean anything personal,&rdquo; he added quickly, and
rose from the easy chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>a fine
moonlight night,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;I shall just take a
turn round and get a mouthful of fresh air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been outside the front door
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;a
few houses off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; she cried severely, &ldquo;do you see
what the time is?&nbsp; Pack off to bed this minute, and
I&rsquo;ll come up and hear you say your prayers.&nbsp; Bid
&lsquo;Good-night&rsquo; to Mr. Swan, and thank him prettily for
what he gave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring a bigger bunch next time,&rdquo; said the child
shrilly.</p>
<p>Swan, walking up and down on the pavement, was hailed by one
or two colleagues on their way home, who asked to be informed
whether he had succeeded in recovering young Mannering&rsquo;s
box: he contented himself by replying to the effect that
negotiations were in progress, and that a full report would be
made in the morning.&nbsp; They predicted that he had for once
bitten off more than he could chew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This takes me back,&rdquo; she remarked brightly, as
she came up, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to say how long.&nbsp;
Wonder whether I can get your step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get accustomed to it,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any objection to me smoking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love a pipe!&nbsp; Oh, but,&rdquo; with sudden <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>agitation,
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you could take my arm!&nbsp; Whatever
will the neighbours think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think what a lucky one I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Swan, you seem to have an answer ready for
everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She announced half an hour later that she did not feel in the
least tired, adding a belief that she could go on walking for
ever; but Swan, who needed his supper, was firm, and at her door
mentioned that he was early duty all the current week.&nbsp; She
offered her hand and thanked him for his kindness; he held it and
asked determinedly where and when could he see her again.&nbsp;
Surely, she retorted, surely once was enough!&nbsp; Once, Swan
announced, was by no means enough&mdash;twenty thousand times
would not, in his opinion, be reckoned sufficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must think I&rsquo;m simple to believe that!&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about to-morrow?&rdquo; he asked, ignoring the
assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you care to come in the evening and have
something to eat before the child goes to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porter Swan, in a moment of inspiration, kissed her hand, thus
striking the exactly right note, and she declared she seemed to
have known him for years.&nbsp; Would Mr. Swan do her one
favour?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Command me!&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>Would he mind taking that lad&rsquo;s box away <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>with him,
and leaving it at the station or somewhere?&nbsp; The sight of it
on the morrow would recall bitter words that she wished to drive
from her memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind obliging you,&rdquo; said Swan,
feigning reluctance, &ldquo;to that extent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had cost a deal of thought and of trouble, but good
repayment came the next morning.&nbsp; He conducted Mannering to
the Up Parcels Office, and there formally presented him with the
tin box, sent free from the suburban station as &ldquo;Luggage
Left Behind.&rdquo;&nbsp; The staff of the Up Parcels Office
cheered Swan, and, clustering around, begged to be informed how
the feat had been accomplished, and had to interpret a wink given
as reply.&nbsp; Porter Swan waved aside the lad&rsquo;s thanks,
declined the grateful offer of refreshments, and walked out with
the air of a successful diplomatist leaving the Guildhall after
receiving in a gold casket the freedom of the City.&nbsp; During
the day he found a new regard paid to him; colleagues came for
private conference on knotty points of law, ranging from
difficulties with a neighbour concerning cats to the regaining of
engagement rings held by lady bailees.&nbsp; It was all very
pleasant and gratifying, and, in order to enjoy it to the full,
he gave less than his usual energy to the collection of tips,
actually leaving one leisurely passenger without allowing her
time to find her purse.</p>
<p>Not until a client, searching for sound <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>legal
advice, and finding it impossible to state his case amidst the
puffing and whistling of engines, inquired: &ldquo;What are you
doing with yourself this evening, old man?&rdquo;&mdash;not until
then did he recall the circumstance that he had promised to eat a
meal on the occasion of his ensuing visit.&nbsp; He wanted to see
her again&mdash;just once more, at any rate&mdash;and he knew
domestic authorities were not too well pleased when disappointed
in regard to a guest.&nbsp; To arrive after the supper hour would
mar the warmth and geniality of his reception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mannering!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Swan.&nbsp; Anything I can do for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a little more information out of you, my
lad.&nbsp; You gave me a vague sort of description of the food
that was given you at that last place; just let me have a few
more details&mdash;the exact truth about, say, the last meal you
had there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the lad complied Swan&rsquo;s forehead took an extra
crease; young Mannering spoke with the fluency of one dealing
with a subject on which he felt deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady on!&rdquo; protested Swan.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been so awful as all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was worse!&rdquo; declared the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
jolly sight worse!&nbsp; At first it seemed all right; but the
third day&mdash;&nbsp; You ought to have been there!&nbsp; If you
&rsquo;appen to have a <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>taste for tough meat&mdash;they say
there&rsquo;s nothing like leather; but that&rsquo;s a
mistake&mdash;overdone and all black at the edges, why, you would
have enjoyed yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t look like a woman who can&rsquo;t
cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very nice person,&rdquo; agreed the lad
judicially, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got no other fault to find
whatsoever.&nbsp; Horrible particular, though, about late
hours.&nbsp; Old-fashioned and out of date, I call
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean,&rdquo; roared Swan impetuously,
&ldquo;by talking in that way about a lady?&nbsp; Keep a civil
tongue in your head, will you?&nbsp; Who are you, I should like
to know, to find fault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad begged for pardon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about food?&rdquo; he raved on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Accustomed to nothing but raw turnips hitherto, how can
you possibly tell whether cooking is good or not?&nbsp; Be off
and see about your work, or else I&rsquo;ll get you shifted back
to that toad-in-the-hole station in the country.&nbsp; Coming up
here,&rdquo; continued Swan aggrievedly, &ldquo;and dictating to
Londoners about food&mdash;I never heard of such
impudence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode to the porters&rsquo; room&rsquo;, and, flinging off
his jacket, sat at the desk and took a penholder, assuming the
attitude of mental stress common to those who start upon literary
efforts.&nbsp; Like many others in similar position, <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>he found
himself baulked at the very start.&nbsp; Should he, in writing to
excuse himself from paying his call until after the hour of
supper, begin, &ldquo;My dear Madam&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dear
Friend,&rdquo; or, his memory going back to the days of youth,
dare to write &ldquo;Sweetest&rdquo;?&nbsp; He tried all of
these, and others, and could not persuade himself to feel
satisfied with any.&nbsp; The old remedy of shining boots gave
him an idea that brought back contentment to his features, and he
went about his tasks for the remainder of the day humming
cheerfully.&nbsp; At six o&rsquo;clock he ran around to the
eating-house near to the station and ordered a special eightpenny
steak, with chipped potatoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll save me!&rdquo; remarked Porter Swan.</p>
<p>In marching down towards Railway Terrace he could not help
thinking of his soldier days when there was never a dearth of
housemaids, and never a one who did not, sooner or later, betray
some defect which led to cessation of amiabilities.&nbsp; Here,
again, was a case of a trim little woman who, if she but knew how
to cook, might well be either highly commended or, perhaps,
awarded the prize of second marriage.&nbsp; He had enjoyed his
meal at the eating-house, and felt willing to look on the world
with an indulgent air; nevertheless, he could not help seeing the
drawback was serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, my dear!&rdquo; as the child opened the
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;How are we this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>&ldquo;Brought me anythink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to a few chocolates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Swan,&rdquo; called a pleasant voice from the
kitchen, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you go spoiling her.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s not been behaving nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand &rsquo;em over!&rdquo; ordered the youngster.</p>
<p>The mother came through the passage, slightly flushed by the
fire or from confusion, reproved her daughter for want of
manners, gave a welcome to Mr. Swan, and expressed a hope that he
had a good appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with
me,&rdquo; he replied anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t
get better I shall have to see a chemist.&nbsp; I could no more
touch food at the present moment than I could swim the
Channel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very sorry, but you must excuse me,
reelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; she said with distress.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind sitting down and watching us eat, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll suit me,&rdquo; declared Swan, entering
the room.</p>
<p>The table was neatly set out for three, with glasses, shining
knives and forks, an attractive roll of bread at each
plate.&nbsp; She went to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a fowel,&rdquo; whispered the child
importantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Roast fowel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to my share,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>This, repeated with some extravagance, caused the
child&rsquo;s mother to stop as she came <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>in with the
dish.&nbsp; She said &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; in such a pained way that
he hastened to assure her no reflection upon her culinary skill
was intended; the internal complaint from which he was suffering
had to take the responsibility.&nbsp; The child said grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a first-rate carver,&rdquo; he said
interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tender bird,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me as though it&rsquo;s beautifully
done,&rdquo; declared the astonished Swan, his mouth
watering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was cook in a good family before I married my
first,&rdquo; she explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve once
learnt, you never forget.&nbsp; When I get a lodger who keeps
good hours I take a pride in preparing his meals.&nbsp; When he
doesn&rsquo;t, I know enough about cooking to cook so that he
doesn&rsquo;t want to stop.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The staff subscribed threepences, and bought a fish knife and
fork.&nbsp; Porter Swan sent in an application for leave, and for
passes&mdash;passes for two: self and wife.</p>
<h2><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>XVII&mdash;MAGNIFICENT REMEDIES</h2>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Don&rsquo;t</span> want to
bother you,&rdquo; remarked the toddling baby, catching the hem
of the other&rsquo;s overcoat; &ldquo;but if you could spare a
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let me see,&rdquo; said the Deep Thinker, looking
down sideways at the small child and giving the pull-up of the
cuffs preparatory to the making of an arch with two hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me see, now.&nbsp; Where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Notting Dale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, how far have we advanced?&nbsp; At what stage
have we arrived?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t arrived at all,&rdquo; answered the baby
shortly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just starting, and it seems to me
I&rsquo;m starting in rather unfortunate circumstances.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not going to say anything against my father and mother;
but, really, unless some one else steps in and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast!&rdquo; interrupted the Deep Thinker,
taking off pince-nez and shaking it reprovingly at the
child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us consider this case of yours fully, in
all its various <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>aspects.&nbsp; We must hasten slowly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
fully prepared to help you in every possible manner, and you can
safely leave the case in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away, then!&rdquo; said the infant.</p>
<p>The Deep Thinker, turning up the collar of his overcoat, found
a sheltered space near the Sirdar Road schools, and opened the
discussion, picking phrases so carefully that sometimes when the
right word came first he rejected it, substituting one which
represented second thoughts.&nbsp; The question to be
decided&mdash;this he offered truculently as his humble
opinion&mdash;was that nothing could be done for the Notting Dale
baby until a large, momentous, important point received
satisfactory settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the Act of 1870, you will
remember&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child protested that it knew nothing of events happening
so long ago; the Deep Thinker lifted a warning forefinger as
insistent demand for silence.&nbsp; Warming to the arguments, he
began to wave arms, to adopt emphatic forms of gesture; the boy
stood clear, watching, and endeavouring to follow the involved
and tortuous reasoning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall we,&rdquo; said the
Deep Thinker, &ldquo;or shall we not reimpose tests?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The youngster gave the sigh of one struggling to understand and
unable to see light.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ought we or ought we not to
oppose with all the force and strength we possess
undenominational religion; and, <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>if so, why?&rdquo;&nbsp; The other
muttered, &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s ajar!&rdquo; and, turning,
found a little pack of grubby cards in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We proceed now to consider the point of full popular
control, and here is a subject on which I shall take the liberty
of speaking at some length.&nbsp; It is a difficult point, and I
beg you to give me your complete and absolute
attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I jolly well sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; replied
the other definitely.</p>
<p>It appeared an audience was not indispensable so long as the
Deep Thinker could be permitted to talk without interruption; he
found so much pleasure in the task that he gave a high giggle of
satisfaction when, having set up a limp argument made of straw
with the preface &ldquo;But then my opponents will
say&mdash;,&rdquo; he knocked it down and jumped exultantly upon
it with &ldquo;I rather think that answers the other
side!&rdquo;&nbsp; As time went on, he became slightly hoarse,
and the other standing near (whose manners really seemed to be
getting worse and worse) warned him that his throat would
presently resemble a nutmeg-grater; the Deep Thinker took a voice
lozenge, gaining from this enough refreshment to enable him to
proceed.&nbsp; Public speakers can be divided into two
sets&mdash;one not knowing where to begin, and the other not
knowing where to leave off; it was evident to which party the
Deep Thinker belonged, for <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>whenever it seemed he was
approaching finality and nothing remained but to take definite
action, he always managed to discover a new and another branch on
which he could perch himself and twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For each individual, after due consideration of the
convictions of others, the final authority as to the right or
wrong of any opinion or action should be his own conscientious
and well-reasoned judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Policemen came up and interfered between the lad and the girl
who was suffering from his blows; the Deep Thinker, his attention
distracted by the incident, begged the constables not to arrest
the youth until the arguments that were being delivered should
come to an end; and the two members of the F Division, touching
helmets, went off reluctantly, taking good note of the features
of the combative parties.&nbsp; The young man now made no
pretence of listening.&nbsp; As quiet folk went by he made a
snatch at their watches or at their purses, or at both, and when
success attended his efforts he was absent for a time, returning
with a slight hiccough and a flushed countenance.</p>
<p>He had developed during the discussion from a round-eyed,
attractive infant to a bulgy, sullen youth with a shifting
expression that never escaped aggressiveness.&nbsp; As the Deep
Thinker announced that only a few brief words remained to be
said, the youth temporarily gave up the task of <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>incommoding
his fellows, and offered a look of hopefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am warned,&rdquo; said the Deep Thinker, blinking
around, &ldquo;that time does not stand still, and I propose
therefore to put my remaining arguments into the briefest
possible space.&nbsp; I flatter myself I am a man of action,
rather than a man of words.&nbsp; The time has come to be up and
doing.&nbsp; We must gird on our sword for the fray.&nbsp; The
trumpet call is sounding, and it is the hour for coming to close
quarters.&nbsp; First of all, however, I should like to run over
the various heads of the arguments I have used, and freshen them,
if I may say so&mdash;freshen them in your memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the Deep Thinker meant by this proved to be that he
should give himself an encore and accept it, for he went through
the whole of his exhaustive address again, adding to it
considerably here and there, and whenever he became involved in a
thick undergrowth of words, laboriously retraced his footsteps
and recommenced the journey.&nbsp; The lad, become a man, short
and defiant, with a stubbly beard, made a very satisfactory haul
from two well-dressed people, returning later with a revolver,
that gave him a great amount of interest; the Deep Thinker broke
off to urge him to be careful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crux of the whole question,&rdquo; said the Deep
Thinker, resuming, &ldquo;put shortly is simply this.&nbsp; The
moral life involves neither acceptance nor rejection of belief in
any deity, <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>personal or impersonal, or in a life after
death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly the bearded man did not fully comprehend the
intention of this remark; probable, too, that, having been talked
to for a considerable length of time, his sense of appreciation
had become dulled.&nbsp; At any rate, a City gentleman, hurrying
home, found himself at his last destination sooner than he

to the station; his evidence as witness would be required, but
the Deep Thinker assured them earnestly that, absorbed by a
particular topic, he had seen nothing of the affair.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
